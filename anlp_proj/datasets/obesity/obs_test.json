        "HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS-2": "HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS  This is a 56 year old black female\nwith coronary artery disease ,\nstatus post three myocardial infarctions and a coronary artery\nbypass graft between the years of 1973 and 1984 , who now came into\nthe hospital with back pain and one episode of dizziness with a\nracing heart. Her cardiac history begins in 1973 when she had her\nfirst myocardial infarction. She has had two more in 1983 and in\n1984. She had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1984 in which her\nLIMA was placed to her LAD , and the saphenous vein graft placed to\nher obtuse marginal and the diagonal branch. The coronary artery\nbypass graft in 1984 was very successful , and she has been stable\nsince that time without angina or congestive heart failure\nsymptoms. She reports that she had a negative exercise tolerance\ntest one year ago , Holter two to three years ago was reportedly\nnormal also. The only time the patient recalls having a racing\nheart prior to the day of admission was when her brother died two\nyears ago.\nOn the day of admission , the patient awoke with a dull ,\nnonradiating pain between her shoulder blades that remained until\nthe patient was given 02 in the Emergency Ward which was\napproximately 12 hours after awakening. The patient was never with\nthis pain before the day of admission. In additional , as the\npatient was walking down the street near her home on the morning of\nthe day of admission , she felt herself stagger , and the world\nseemed to rotate around her. She sat down for about 10 minutes\nuntil the spell passed. During this episode , her back pain did not\nchange in quality or intensity. She had no chest pain , shortness\nof breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , loss of consciousness ,\ntrauma , headache , neck stiffness , blurry vision , paroxysmal\nnocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. She does report an accompanying\nracing heart that seemed regular. After this episode , the patient\ndrove herself to the Georgeb.sonhan Hospital Emergency Ward\nfor evaluation.",
        "REVIEW OF SYSTEMS-3": "REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  The patient had menopause at 42 years of age.\nShe has never had a mammogram or regular breast exams. The rest of\nher review of systems was noncontributory. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nCoronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft\nin 1984 as reported in the history of the present illness. She has\nhad hypertension for ten years. An echocardiogram in 3/27 showed\nleft ventricular enlargement , inferior apicokinesis , lateral\nhypokinesis , and 1+ mitral regurgitation. ALLERGIES: To\nPenicillin which leads to anaphylaxis. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\nWere only Isordil and Cardizem. The patient has a 15 pack-year\nhistory of smoking. She quit two months ago. She does not drink\nalcohol or abuse IV drugs. She lives alone and is unemployed as an\nunemployed LPN , and has one child.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-4": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  She was a well developed well nourished\nblack female very anxious and teary eyed.\nBlood pressure on admission was 180/90 in the right arm and 180/95\nin the left arm , pulses were equal at 72. She was afebrile at\n98.7 , and respirations of 20. She was not orthostatic. The skin\nwas warm and dry. There were no rashes or bleeding. HEENT exam\nwas benign. The neck was supple , positive jugular venous\ndistention at about 10 cm , but no coronary artery bruits. The\nlungs were clear. The back was without costovertebral angle\ntenderness or spinal tenderness. Cardiovascular exam: Regular\nrate and rhythm with an S3 and a palpable S4 , with a holosystolic\nmurmur at the apex and a systolic ejection murmur at the left lower\nsternal border. No radiation of either murmur. Her PMI was\ndiffuse with a sternal heave. Abdominal exam was benign.\nExtremities were benign. Pulses: Femoral on the left with a\nbruit , and 2+ femoral on the right without a bruit , and 1+. The\nrest of the pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally. No renal artery bruits\nwere heard. Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented ,\nand her exam was nonfocal.",
        "LABORATORY DATA-5": "LABORATORY DATA  On admission showed a normal SMA-7. Her\nhematocrit was 41.5 with a low MCV at 78.7 , low\nMCH at 31.3 , and a RDW of 16.1. The patient ruled out for a\nmyocardial infarction with normal CK's. Her chest x-ray showed a\nglobular heart , question of some cardiomegaly , clearly post\ncoronary artery bypass graft with lots of clips. She had right\natrial enlargement with loss of the retrosternal air space , but no\nevidence of aortic widening of the mediastinum. No pulmonary\nedema , no pulmonary vascular redistribution was detected. EKG\nshowed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with a PR interval of .14 , QRS\n.11 , and a QT of .45. She had left atrial enlargement , old lateral\nT-wave inversions as well as inferior T-wave inversions. The\npatient had no acute changes.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-6": "HOSPITAL COURSE  Involved placing the patient on a cardiac\nmonitor , rule her out for an myocardial\ninfarction , obtaining exercise stress test , echocardiogram , drawing\nblood for thyroid function tests , VMA's , metanephrines in the\nurine. In addition , a beta blocker was added to her hypertensive\nregimen , and she was started on an aspirin a day. Her cardiac\nmonitor demonstrated no dysrhythmias except for a few PVC's. The\nresults of the 24 hour Holter on discharge were still pending. She\nruled out for a myocardial infarction. An exercise stress test\nshowed that the patient went 5 minutes and 45 seconds on a standard\nBruce protocol , no ischemic symptoms , stopped due to leg pains.\nEKG was with 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in V4 and V5. It was\nreportedly consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Because\nof this , the patient should probably have an exercise MIBI on the\noutside as an outpatient. An echocardiogram demonstrated an\nejection fraction of 45-50% , severe hypokinesis of the\nanterolateral and posterior wall , akinesis of the inferior wall ,\n2-3+ mitral regurgitation , and an intra-atrial septal aneurysm , no\ntumor or thrombus was detected.\nLaboratory studies on admission did demonstrate an elevated protein\nof 8.5 and a globulin fraction of 4.2. Therefore , an S-PEP , IgG\nand IgM's were sent and were pending on discharge.",

        "SERVICE-2": "SERVICE \nGeneral Medical Service Bile Port\nIn summary , this patient is a 73-year-old lady with a history of\nlow back pain , sciatica , morbid obesity , spinal stenosis ,\nhypothyroidism , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , posthepatic\nneuralgia , rheumatoid arthritis , renal insufficiency , deep vein\nthrombosis , bilateral total knee replacement secondary to\ndegenerative joint disease , who is admitted on 8/15/04 for\nworsening low back pain. The following is a continuation of the\nhospital events during her stay.\n1. Low back pain: As stated before , she suffers from\ndebilitating low back pain from morbid obesity , spinal stenosis ,\nrheumatoid arthritis , and degenerative joint disease. During her\nhospitalization , her pain was treated with narcotics as well as a\nsteroid/analgesic epidural injection. The Pain Service followed\nduring her discharge day. Her pain control with narcotics was\ntitrated with a fentanyl patch along with breakthrough p.o.\nDilaudid. She was also titrated up on her chronic pain\nmedications including Neurontin and Elavil. The patient had a\nhistory of sedation with too much narcotics , and her narcotics\nshould be titrated for mental status changes. During her stay ,\nshe received IV conscious sedation MRI , which showed a normal\nspinal cord and spinal stenosis , facet involvement. Orthopedics\nsurgery was consulted early during the hospitalization and they\ndetermined that there was no surgical indication for orthopedic\nsurgery. They were also reconsulted later on when the patient\nappeared to want to have surgery , and at that time orthopedics\nsurgery determined that the risk-benefit ratio was not in favor ,\nand that she was not a surgical candidate in the context of a\nnewly developed right lower extremity DVT. As mentioned before ,\nthe patient had an epidural injection with bupivacaine and\nsteroids on 7/8/05 with minimal initial response to her pain.\nHowever , later , there was some improvement in her pain. The\npatient is to follow at the Pain Clinic in two weeks , as further\nappointments in the follow up section for a possible repeat\nepidural injection. In addition , she is to follow up with Dr.\nFarella within four weeks of the Orthopedics Surgery Service for\nreevaluation for the orthopedics surgery. In addition , she\nreceived aggressive physical therapy , which slowly enabled her to\nimprove her range of movement in her lower extremities. She does\nhave chronic and stable left lower extremity immobility.\nHowever , she is able to move her right leg somewhat and this has\nimproved slowly over time with aggressive PT. The patient has\nvery agreeable of recent days to physical therapy and is expected\nto continue to improve with continued aggressive physical\ntherapy. This should be the mainstay of her treatment in\naddition to her pain control with her medications. She should be\npremedicated with Dilaudid or any pain control medications prior\nto any physical therapy session.\n2. Cardiovascular: The patient had stable cardiovascular\nparameters during her admission and did not require any\nsignificant changes in her outpatient medications. Medications\nare as listed in the discharge medications.\n3. Endocrine: She has severe diabetes mellitus and insulin\nresistence. Her NPH was titrated due to episodes of asymptomatic\nhypoglycemia to the range of 45 to 55 in the fasting morning\nglucoses of normal need. On discharge , the patient was\nmaintained on NPH insulin b.i.d. as well as sliding scale of\nregular insulin. He also had a history of hypothyroidism and her\nSynthroid was continued. She had a history of renal\ninsufficiency and received a chronic low dose of prednisone. She\ndid not have any issues while she was in the hospital.\n4. Rheumatology: The patient has rheumatoid arthritis. Her\nprednisone was decreased in duration of her stay from prednisone\n20 mg p.o. q.a.m. to 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. She also is on as an\noutpatient on her home dose of methotrexate 20 mg p.o. q. week ,\nwhich was held during her hospitalization due to her acute\nissues. However , the methotrexate , which was prescribed by her\noutpatient rheumatology , should be restarted as an outpatient as\nsoon as possible. She takes 20 mg p.o. q. week.\n5. Renal: Initially , the patient had a mild increase in her\ncreatinine on presentation , but this improved to the normal range\nwith gentle hydration.\n6. Infectious disease: The patient had a fever on 4/22/04 to\n101 and on 6/26/05 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Cultures were\nnegative. There were white blood cells in her urine and she was\nempirically given levofloxacin. She did have cough and sputum ,\nand she was found to have MRSA in her sputum and was known to be\ncolonized at this point , and was placed on precautions. However ,\nher chest x-ray was clear. She did not have a clinical\npneumonia. Her lower extremity appeared red and woody and there\nwas question of cellulitis , and she received 10 days of p.o.\nKeflex , although it was unlikely she had two cellulitis.\n7. Pulmonary: She likely has obstructive sleep apnea with a\nmild decrease in O2 saturations at night. However , this was\nnever clinically significant. Her body habitus and symptoms were\nconsistent with obstructive sleep apnea. Chest x-rays were also\ntaken during her course and were unchanged from her prior.\nAlthough , she has had a history of being fitted for a C-PAP mask ,\nshe refused to use this.\n8. Hematology: She was diagnosed with a DVT in her right leg by\nultrasound on 6/26/05 , and was started on a heparin drip , which\nwas bridged to warfarin with therapeutic INR during the rest of\nher stay. The plan is for her to continue six months of\nanticoagulation , then reevaluation by her outpatient primary care\nphysician. Her current dose of Coumadin is 6 mg p.o. q.h.s. and\nthis should be checked one week after discharge from the hospital\nin order to ensure a goal INR of 2 to 3. Until than she will be\nmaintained on Lovenox 40 mg subu q.d. in the hospital , and this\ncan be continued as needed as an outpatient.\n9. Physical therapy: As per above , the patient is engaged in\nphysical therapy and showed improvement over time.\n10. GI: The patient has intermittent constipation to her pain\nmedications and has poor p.o. intake in general , however , this\nimproved over the course of admission. She requires an\naggressive bowel regimen to keep her regular bowel movements and\nshe will be often resonant to have a bowel movement due to the\nfeeling of vertigo during the bowel movements. This , however ,\nimproved during time. She should be encouraged to allow herself\nto have bowel movement in the rest room if she is able. The goal\nwill be for her to be able to sit on a toilet potty at the\nbedside.\n11. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient had\nintermittent , non-clinically significant hyperkalemia , which\ninitially was corrected with Kayexalate and bowel movements.\n12. Psychiatric: The patient had intermittent vocalization of\nnot caring if she lived or died because she had lived her life\nand she was in pain. She was seen by the psychiatry multiple\ntimes. She did not think that she was suicidal and only need\nemotional support to which she responded well. At the time of\ndischarge , she was euthymic and hopeful and was eager to continue\nto improve her quality of life with aggressive physical therapy\nand pain control. She was looking forward to continuing her pain\ncontrol management follow up visit with pain service.\n13. The patient has declared herself to be DNR/DNI.\nTO-DO PLAN , FOLLOW-UP PLAN:\n1. Aggressive physical therapy and pain control , as directed by\nthe pain clinic and her primary care physician.\n2. After her discharge from rehabilitation , she should follow up\nwith her rheumatologist Dr. Boughamer , pain clinic , Dr. Cills ,\nwhich is her primary care physician in Orthopedics.\n3. She is also noted to be MRSA colonized and should be on\nappropriate precautions. She should continue her Coumadin for\nsix months for her deep vein thrombosis until otherwise directed\nby the physician. The pain clinic will consider additional\ntherapy for pain including epidural repeat as an outpatient. The\npatient should restart her methotrexate as an outpatient.\nFOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:\nAt this time , she has an appointment with Dr. Boore at the\nNardon Hospital Pain Clinic at Mont Ox Delp , phone number\n286-351-0157 on 7/9/05 at 2:30 p.m. She also has an\nappointment with Dr. Christofferse , Orthopedic Surgery at the Middrise Et Brynta Hospital Orthopedic Service on the Jo Renford Pu\nGlenda Li Sabuffta at Park Health , phone number\n967-787-5406 on 10/1/05 at 10:30 a.m. She should have her INR\ndrawn in one week after discharge and follow up INR is to be\ndrawn every seven days until therapeutic. The INR should be\nfollowed by her rehabilitation/nursing facility.",

She has a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung\ncancer and has been receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy\ntreatments. She presented outside the window for thrombolysis or\nintervention. Exam revealed plegia of the left face and arm , paresis of\nthe left leg , and an incomplete neglect syndrome. MRI/MRA revealed\npartial right MCA territory stroke and suggested severe proximal right\nICA stenosis; she was placed on heparin. Antihypertensives , aside from\nlow-dose metoprolol , were held. CT/CTA head and neck the following day\nconfirmed a severe proximal right ICA stenosis and revealed evolution of\nthe stroke to involve much of the right MCA territory. The heparin was\ndiscontinued and the patient placed back on clopidogrel. The Hoaggan Memorial Hospital\nunder Dr. Aiu evaluated the patient and recommended a follow-up\nappointment with him two weeks after discharge.\nLaboratory work-up pertinent to stroke revealed a normal homocysteine ,\nnormal TSH , lipid profile with LDL 108 , HDL 52 , TG 131 , and Lp( a )\nlipoprotein elevated at 93. She was continued on a statin , and low-dose\nniacin added to the regimen because of the Lp( a ) results. Her hemoglobin\nA1c and random blood sugars were elevated; she received an insulin\nsliding scale. Echocardiogram showed normal LVEF and size , no wall motion\nabnormalities , + evidence of diastolic dysfunction , and normal LA size.\nHer cell counts trended downward in an expected fashion given the timing\nof her most recent chemotherapy. She was placed on neutropenic\nprecautions. Her oncologist Dr. Batrez recommended administering\nprophylactic ciprofloxacin and a single dose of long-acting G-CSF. She is\nnot planned to receive any additional chemotherapeutic or radiation\ntherapy treatments in the near future.\nHer neurological examination remained stable. Repeat head CTs done to\nassess for edema following the stroke revealed some effacement of the\nright lateral ventricle , but no threatening mass effect.\nHer serum sodium trended down throughout admission; it is recommended\nthat she not receive hypotonic fluids at rehab and that she be water\nrestricted to 1L per day , and take salt as directed.\nGiven her thrombocytopenia , it is recommended that antiplatelet therapy\nwith clopidogrel be held until her platelet count rises over 100. It is\nalso recommended that anticoagulation with therapeutic low-molecular\nweight heparin as bridge to warfarin with target INR 2-3 be restarted 2\nweeks after her stroke , on 2/16/05. She should follow up for\nneurological issues with Dr. Sagan of neurosurgery as well as her\noutpatient neurologist , Dr. Collin Krauskopf , at Cako Hospital",

The\npatient had a history of rheumatic fever as a child , and she\npresented in 1985 with mitral and aortic valvular endocarditis\nfollowing a root canal. She subsequently underwent aortic and\nmitral valve replacement secondary to her aortic and mitral\ninsufficiency. Her perioperative course was complicated by a brain\nabscess which was without neurologic residual deficit. In 1989 the\npatient again presented with recurrent endocarditis and underwent a\nrepeat mitral valve and aortic valve replacement. For the past year\nprior to presentation , she has had increasing symptoms of right\nheart failure including lower extremity edema and ascites which did\nnot improve with medical treatment. She has also presented with\ncomplaints of shortness of breath. In February of 1993 she underwent\na transesophageal echo which revealed a perivalvular leak for which\nshe underwent her third mitral valve replacement. Tricuspid\nannuloplasty was performed at that time. The patient has never\nsignificantly improved past her most recent surgery and her most\nrecent transesophageal echo performed in Ta Ca Elponcevo three\nweeks prior to presentation demonstrated again a perivalvular\nmitral leak. The patient has had a significant lower extremity\nedema with a weight gain of 30 pounds since her discharge one month\nago.

She , therefore , underwent mitral valve\nrepair on 2 of November but was without significant symptoms for her\nright heart failure , and was placed on the cardiac transplant list.\nShe underwent successful cardiac transplantation on 18 of September .  Since\nthat time , her main issues have centered over management of her\nresidual ascites with diuresis of her third spaced volume.\nAdditionally she had had some nose bleeds preoperatively which were\nfelt to be related to nasal polyps for which she was seen by the\nENT Service. She underwent routine post transplant biopsies and\nechocardiograms , all of which showed adequate acceptance of organs\nand good LV function. She continued to do quite well with the\nexception of some dysphagia early in her postoperative course which\nwas found to be possibly secondary to some esophageal ulcerations ,\nbut these have subsequently resolved and she is tolerating a\nregular diet. She was noted two days prior to transfer to the\nNorri Verlan Medical Center to have some diffuse mild\nabdominal pain , and KUB and upright revealed large amounts of\nstool , and she felt great relief from soap suds enemas.

The patient was given a low fat ADA diet.\n7. Endocrine. The patient's sugars are moderately well\ncontrolled on regular insulin sliding scale. NPH insulin was\nadded and has been titrated up to 12 units q.a.m. with regular\ninsulin sliding scale for coverage on top of that. The patient\nwith known hypothyroidism was euthyroid on admission. TSH was\nwithin normal limit. Her home dose Synthroid continued and\nshould be indefinitely.\n8. Hematology: Given the patient atrial fibrillation , she had\nbeen on Coumadin at the outside hospital; however , on\npresentation , her INR was subtherapeutic at 1.2. She was put on\nLovenox prophylactic dose prior to the surgery , and following\nsurgery Coumadin was restarted and up titrated to 30 range. On\ndischarge , she was therapeutic with an INR of 2.0 , Coumadin dose\nof 5 mg q.h.s. Her hematocrit has fell following the surgery ,\nand she has transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells on\nMay , 2005. Since then , her hematocrit has increased\nappropriately and she has been stable throughout her rest of\nadmission. On discharge , the hematocrit was 39.0.\n9.

It was felt that the Lasix drip was ineffective and\nrecommended starting 200 mg IV Lasix t.i.d. with the goal of\nkeeping the patient 1.5 to 2.5 liters negative per day. The\npatient had difficulty with repletion of potassium during the\nentire hospital stay. Patient does not tolerate well either the\nimmediate release oral form of potassium or the IV form. The IV\nform hurts the IV site and the oral form makes him nauseous , but he\nstill prefers the oral form. Over the course of the admission , 10\nmg p.o. twice daily of slow released potassium was started and ,\neventually , was 30 mg twice daily at the end of his stay.\nCaptopril was added to the regimen at 12.5 mg three times a day on\nthe second hospital day and was eventually raised to 50 mg three\ntimes a day as his blood pressure tolerated , which took four days.\nCreatinine remained stable throughout admission and did not affect\nour ability to diurese with Lasix. After six days , the patient was\nadequately diuresed. JVP was now not visible. Lungs were clear.\nThere was no edema. The patient is tolerating captopril well.\nCoumadin , which had been 4 mg per day on admission , was cut to 2 mg\nper day because of the high INR on admission. Two days prior to\ndischarge , INR fell to 1.9. Patient was restarted on 4 mg per day.\nAt discharge , INR was 1.7. Patient does not wish to stay to have\nINR corrected.

Coronary risk factors include a positive\nfamily history , no smoking , diabetes mellitus , hypertension or\nelevated cholesterol. The patient's history begins in 1971 when ,\nafter a tubal ligation , she had a pulmonary emboli which was felt\nto be secondary to prolonged bedrest. She received Heparin and was\ncoumadinized for one year. In 1988 she had lower abdominal pain ,\nextensive work up of which revealed a pulmonary emboli , and again\nshe was heparinized and coumadinized for one year. On September , 1994\nshe developed the acute onset of intermittent chest pressure and\nleft arm heaviness , associated with night sweats. There was no\nshortness of breath , palpitations , light-headedness , nausea or\nvomiting. The pain was exacerbated by deep breaths as well as\nyawning and movement. It was not relieved by any factors. On the\nmorning of admission the discomfort progressed from intermittent to\nconstant and was unrelieved with two Advils , at which time she\nsubsequently presented to the W.coness- County General Hospital\nEmergency Ward. In the Emergency Ward her examination was\nnegative. Chest x-ray was negative. VQ scan was with intermediate\nprobability. She received Heparin and was subsequently transferred\nto the floor. She denied any fevers , chills , cough , shortness of\nbreath , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal pain or dysuria. It is\nnoteworthy that the patient had an Emergency Ward visit on April\nat which time she complained of sore throat. Rapid Strep test was\npositive for Strep pharyngitis. She was treated with a course of\nPenicillin. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is as\nabove. She also has a history of dysfunctional uterine bleeding ,\niron deficiency anemia , lumbosacral disc disease , status post\nlaminectomy times three. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Medications on\nadmission are Motrin prn. ALLERGIES: She has no known drug\nallergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Her mother died from complications\nfrom hypertension. Her father died from a cerebrovascular\naccident. She has one sister who is deceased from burn injuries ,\none brother who passed away from a myocardial infarction at age 57 ,\nand two brothers who passed away from natural causes. SOCIAL",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "HOSPITAL COURSE  It was felt that during the patient's\npresentation the most likely diagnosis was a\npulmonary embolus , given her clinical history and her intermediate\nprobability of VQ scan. The elevated CK with the very low MB was\nfelt not to represent a myocardial infarction but to represent a CK\nleak from presumed pulmonary infarction. The patient was\nheparinized with the goal of maintaining her PTT in the 60 to 80\nrange. She had a thrombotic work up sent off , namely an\nantithrombin 3 , protein C and protein S , all of which , with the\nexception of the Russell viper venom , returned within normal\nlimits. The Russell viper venom is pending at the time of\ndictation. The patient underwent lower extremity noninvasives on\nhospital day number one which returned as negative. She had a D\ndimer sent which was also normal. At this point the DVT Team here\nat the Otver Hospital was consulted , given the\nconflicted data for pulmonary emboli. The team felt that , given\nthe patient's clinical history and the implications of chronic\nCoumadin therapy , that a pulmonary embolus should be definitely\nruled out by pulmonary arteriogram. On hospital day number two the\npatient underwent a PA gram which revealed a mean RA pressure of 7\nmm of mercury , a mean RV pressure of 12 mm of mercury , and no\nfilling defects to suggest a pulmonary embolus. At this point the\npatient's Heparin was discontinued. The day prior to obtaining the\npulmonary arteriogram the patient had a good PA and lateral film ,\nwhich revealed no focal infiltrates and no effusions. On hospital\nday number three the patient underwent an echocardiogram which\nrevealed normal left ventricular size and mild left ventricular\nhypertrophy with vigorous function and no regional wall motion\nabnormalities. She had no pericardial thickening or pericardial\neffusion to suggest pericarditis. She had structurally normal\ncardiac valves , no significant mitral or tricuspid regurge. She\nhad a minimal amount of aortic regurgitation and normal right heart\nsize and function. At this point , given the fact that the patient\nwas not felt to have a myocardial infarction , given her low MB\ntotal CK ratio , and also that she was not felt to have a pulmonary\nembolus , given the negative PA gram , the diagnosis of pleurisy\nsecondary to possible close viral syndrome was considered. The\npatient was started on Naprosyn at 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. on hospital\nday number three , to which she responded quite well. After\ndiscussion with the patient's primary doctor it was felt that ,\ngiven the fact that serious causes for pleuritic chest pain had\nbeen ruled out , the patient's management could be followed in an\noutpatient setting. On hospital day number four it was felt that\nshe was safe to be discharged to home. Operations and procedures\nperformed during this hospitalization were pulmonary arteriogram by\nPa Hospital on April , 1994. There were no complications.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted to this hospital with a\nrecent episode of flash pulmonary edema. When\nthis had happened previously , cardiac catheterization had revealed\nan occluded left circumflex lesion that was stented. There were ,\ntherefore , concerns that the patient may have re-occlusion either\nof the stent or of one of her other vessels. Her metformin was\nheld. She was given pre-cath hydration fluids , and then she\nunderwent cardiac catheterization. The results of this study were\nas follows: The patient had a 40% ostial LAD lesion and an 80% mid\nD1 lesion , both of which showed no change from her prior\ncatheterization. The patient left circumflex stent was widely\npatent. The patient's RCA was noted to be occluded and was filling\nwith collaterals from left to right. At the time of the\ncatheterization , the patient's renal arteries are also evaluated.\nThere was a question of an ostial left renal artery stenosis.\nHowever , no other renal disease was noted.\nBecause the patient's catheterization was unchanged from a prior\nstudy , it was unclear as to the significance of her D1 lesion. For\nthis reason , the patient underwent an ETT MIBI , the results of\nwhich are as follows: The patient underwent a modified Bruce ,\nheart rate of 66% of maximum predicted heart rate. She exercised\nfor 4 minutes 30 seconds and stopped secondary to dyspnea. She had\nno new EKG changes and no chest pain. The MIBI portion of the test\nshowed a nontransmural anterior and inferior MI , with peri-infarct\nischemia involving 3-5 segments. At the time of this dictation , it\nis felt that the patient's CAD is an unlikely explanation for her\npresentation. Dr. Dibernardo will review the MIBI results and decide\nwhether a repeat catheterization with PCI is warranted. The most\nlikely explanation is that the patient has diastolic dysfunction\ngiven her age and history of diabetes. Dr. Hake is interested in\nenrolling her in a study that evaluates angiotensin receptor\nblockers in treatment of this disorder.\nThe patient had an echo during this hospitalization. The left\nventricle is mildly dilated with an EF of 50%. The patient has\napical , septal , and lateral hypokinesis. Her right ventricle size\nand function is normal. The patient also has a dilated left atrium\nwith mild mitral regurgitation.\nDISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with her primary care\nphysician in two weeks and her primary\ncardiologist in four weeks.",

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-4": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  This is a 63-year-old male presenting\nwith unstable angina. His first presentation with coronary disease\nwas in 1986 , when he ruled in for MI and a cath revealed 100%\nocclusion of the circumflex , 99% D1 , and a subsequent angioplasty\nof the circ to a 70% residual. He had an exercise treadmill two\nmonths later and a repeat cath at that time showed 95% restenosis\nof the circ and a 60% LAD lesion , and a 90% D1. In October of\n1992 the patient again presented with exertional angina. Cath\nrevealed 70% occlusion of the RCA , 70-80% LAD , and diffuse disease\nin the circumflex with a 50% mid-circumflex lesion. He had diffuse\nglobal hypokinesis and an EF of 40-50%. His angina progressed and\nin 1994 he underwent a four vessel CABG , SVG to the PDA and OM-1 ,\nand a LIMA to the LAD and D2. He did well until 1997 , when he\npresented with presyncope and was found to have a massive saddle\npulmonary embolism. He had a negative hypercoagulative workup\nafter this. In the recent years he has had a number of episodes of\nepigastric pain with exertion and positive stress tests , but no\nadditional myocardial infarctions. His most recent cath in July\nof 1997 showed an occluded circumflex , 80% LAD , and subtotal\nocclusion distally , a 60% mid-RCA lesion , and patent SVG to the PDA\nand the OM , as well as the LIMA to the LAD. In recent months the\npatient describes increasing frequency of anginal episodes provoked\nby walking more than five minutes or climbing stairs. Most often\nthe pain is epigastric , but occasionally substernal. He denies\nassociated symptoms of nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation of the\npain , but says it is hard to catch his breath. The patient denies\northopnea , PND , or lower extremity edema. He has never had pain at\nrest. On February the patient underwent an exercise treadmill\ntest walking five minutes on the standard Bruce protocol , reaching\na heart rate of 96 and a blood pressure of 130/70. He had chest\npain as well as 1 mm ST depressions. Since then his angina has\noccurred with less and less exertion until the morning of\nadmission , when he walked outside and experienced substernal chest\ntightness. He again denies nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations , or\nradiation of the pain , but does have some shortness of breath. The\npain lasts approximately 10-15 minutes and the patient was advised\nby his cardiologist , Dr. Raymond Merrihew , to come to the Emergent\nDepartment. In the Emergent Department he was pain free and\nreceived aspirin and was started on heparin. EKG showed no acute\nchanges. CK was 47 and a troponin of 0.24.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-10": "HOSPITAL COURSE  1. Cardiovascularly , the patient was continued\non heparin and ruled out for MI by CKs. On 10/21\nhe underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed an 80% proximal\nLAD , 100% proximal circ , 80% proximal RCA , and 80% proximal right\nPDA. His LIMA to the D2 and the LAD were patent , as was the SVG to\nOM-1. The SVG to the RCA was 100% occluded. A stent was placed in\nthe native mid-RCA and angioplasty was undertaken of the right PDA.\nAfter the procedure , the heparin was discontinued and he was\ntransitioned to Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day for DVT prophylaxis. An\necho was obtained , which showed mildly enlarged left ventricle with\nmoderate reduction in function and EF of 35%. There is thinning\nand hypokinesis to akinesis of the posterior and inferior segments ,\nas well as hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal septum. The RV\nwas normal. Pulmonary artery pressures are 25+ right atrial\npressure. The patient continues to have episodes of epigastric\ndiscomfort and belching , and his EKG revealed only nonspecific T\nwave changes. He was scheduled to undergo a submax exercise\ntreadmill test , but this was held due to an increase in his\ntroponin initially from .23 to .73 , suggesting that he was having\nsome mild ischemia with the likely culprit being the small PDA that\nhad been angioplastied during cath. Recath was thought to be low\nyield without anything to intervene upon after discussion with the\ninterventional Cardiology Service. His medical regimen was\nmaximized and included a beta blocker , ACE inhibitor , and nitrates.\nHis cardiac enzymes trended down to a CK of 32 and a troponin of\n0.33 upon discharge. He underwent submaximum ETT on 3/10 and\nwalked for nine minutes without EKG changes , but did experience\n6/10 chest pain and some belching. The test was considered\nconsistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Of note , he\nreached a max heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 142/80\nduring this submaximum stress test. The patient will be discharged\nto home to have close follow-up with his cardiologist , Dr. Devin Peachey He will also have a follow-up stress test. He will see his\nprimary care physician , Dr. Panciera , for monitoring of his other\nmedical issues , including his diabetes.

One ventricular wire and one pericardial tube was\nplaced. A retrosternal tube and a right pleural tube were also\nplaced. Please see dictated operative note for details.\nFollowing his operation , he was transferred to the ICU for\nfurther care and management. The patient was extubated on\npostoperative day #1 and was given supplemental O2 nasal cannula\nat that time. On postoperative day #2 , the patient's chest tubes\nwere removed , and his pacing wires were left in place since the\npatient was found to be asystolic as an underlying rhythm. The\npatient remained in atrial fibrillation and alternated with sinus\nrhythm with first-degree AV block. His atrial fibrillation was\ndifficult to control in the acute postoperative setting , and\ncardiology consult was obtained for further care and management\nof the patient. On postoperative day #3 , the patient had\nshortness of breath and was given Lasix for diuresis. He was 2\nliters negative on postoperative day #3 , though he was still\nincreased from his preoperative weight. His pacing wires were\ndiscontinued on postoperative day #3 as the patient was found to\nhave return of his underlying rhythm. He was started on\nLopressor and on diltiazem at that time. On postoperative day\n#4 , the patient's diltiazem was changed to diltiazem CD 360 mg\nand atenolol 50 mg daily per Dr. Caffarel . The patient was\ngiven a PT consult for home safety evaluation on that day. On\npostoperative day #8 , the patient had an episode of symptomatic\nsinus bradycardia and as a result received a transvenous\npacemaker by the electrophysiology service for the control of the\nsinus bradycardia , and on the day of discharge from the ICU , the\npatient was taken for permanent pacemaker placement by the\nelectrophysiology team.\nThe patient's pain was controlled with Tylenol without\nsignificant pain requirement issues. He was intact\nneurologically on day of discharge , moving all four extremities ,\nand appropriate. From a cardiovascular standpoint , the patient\nwas given his pacemaker and was still in atrial fibrillation as\nhis underlying rhythm. He was given 50 of atenolol as well as\nextended release of diltiazem 360 daily. He was on room satting\nappropriately and was given Atrovent on a p.r.n. basis. He was\ntolerating POs and getting Nexium and Colace from a GI\nperspective. The patient was receiving diuresis with Lasix of 40\np.o. b.i.d. , and his electrolytes were supplemented. From a\nhematologic standpoint , he was given aspirin 81 mg , and his\nCoumadin will be restarted. He had no significant infectious\ndisease issues on the day of discharge. From endocrine\nperspective , the patient was given NPH 24 units q.a.m. and 20\nunits q.p.m and his baseline sliding scale in addition to NovoLog\n10 units as a standing order.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-6": "HOSPITAL COURSE \nThis is a 41-year-old female with a history of diverticulitis and\nquestionable inflammatory bowel disease with a known colonic\nstricture since 4/5 The patient has had attempted to dilatation\nwithout success. The patient has also recent history\nof ribbon like stools and complains of difficulty with bladder\nfunction as well as a sense of urgency to urinate. Her past\nmedical history is significant for diverticulitis , questionable\ninflammatory bowel disease , GERD , depression , chronic pain , and\nhistory of breast cancer. Her surgical history is significant\nfor sigmoid colectomy in 2003 , right breast lumpectomy , axillary\nlymph node dissection in 1998 , as well as multiple Port-a-Cath\nplacements , and endoscopic treatment. She was admitted on\n7/20/04 and taken to the OR for a sigmoid colectomy; the procedure\nwas complicated by a left ureteral injury for which Urology was\nconsulted intraoperatively. Urology placed a left ureteral stent\nintraoperatively and made recommendations to maintain stent for a\ntotal of six weeks after which time it would be removed on an\noutpatient basis ( Dr. Mahaffy will be following this case ). In\naddition , they recommended maintaining Foley for five days. The\nEBL during the case was 2500 cc necessitating transfusion of 4\nunits of packed red blood cells. She was extubated and taken to\nthe PACU in stable condition with an epidural in place on\nperioperative antibiotics of clindamycin and with NG tube in\nplace. On\npostoperative day #1 , it was noted that the patient was\nincreasingly becoming confused and anxious as well as remained\ntachycardic despite what was thought to be adequate volume\nresuscitation and she was transferred to the unit at this point.\nMore specifically , in addition to being tachycardic later that\nday on postoperative day #1 , she became tachypneic with noted\nhypoxemia and mental status changes in need of intubation. Of\nnote , the patient was saturating at 96% on 100% oxygen via\nfacemask. It is also notable that the patient in the 24-hour\nperioperative window received 14-liter of fluid resuscitation.\nThe night of postoperative day #1 , as mentioned earlier , the\npatient was increasingly agitated before she was transferred to\nthe unit and although discontinued her NG tube it was thought at\nthis time that she may have aspirated. She also removed her\nsupplemental oxygen and was noted to have saturations in the 85%\nrange with tachycardia in the 140 range. A PE protocol CT was\nobtained that was negative for emboli or DVT but was positive for\nright upper lobe posterior segment consolidation that was\nconsistent with an aspiration event. She was subsequently\ntransferred on the night of postoperative day #1 to the ICU ,\nintubated , and had a right IJ central line placed. Overnight ,\nbetween postoperative day #1 and postoperative day #2 , her blood\npressure would drop requiring multiple fluid boluses in addition\nto the administration of an additional unit of packed red blood\ncells for a hematocrit of 23. She also received albumin. Of\nnote , the CT also did not reveal any evidence of acute bleed;\nhowever , this was a noncontrast study. She was placed on Versed\nand propofol , intubated in the unit with a fentanyl patch ,\nremained tachycardic , the origin of which was unclear. It was\nthought initially that there was some type of narcotic control\nthat may be responsible for this tachycardia. However , it was\nalso speculated that she may be bleeding from an unknown source.\nShe was intubated , NPO , NG tube in place with IV fluid\nresuscitation , Foley in place per Urology as noted above , on subq\nheparin with close monitoring of the hematocrit with transfusions\nto be given as necessary placed on a triple regimen of\nclindamycin , levo , and Flagyl. On postoperative day #3 , the\npatient in the unit with hypertension , anemia , tachycardia , the\npatient's hematocrit was still 23 and she received 2 additional\nunits of red blood cells and hematocrit rose to 30 at this time.\nShe was poorly responsive on postoperative day #3 and it was\nthought that she had better be weaned off of Versed which\nhappened to be replaced with haloperidol. In addition , clonidine\nwas added to her regimen as well as Lopressor secondary to her\ntachycardia. There was close examination of her mental status\nduring this time. On postoperative day #4 , the patient was still\npersistently tachycardic and hypertensive. JP was discontinued\non the day and , in addition , as noted above , Haldol and clonidine\nwere added to her regimen. She continued to be agitated and\nthere was a question raised then that there was an unclear\nhistory that was not previously diagnosed of alcoholism and this\nmay have been an alcohol withdrawal phenomenon. So , her Versed\nactually was increased then for a questionable alcohol withdrawal\nand she was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate and in\naddition for her hypertension Lopressor 5 q.4 was continued. She\nwas still intubated with goals of weaning off ventilation , NPO ,\nNG tube to low suction , the question of TPN was raised , levo and\nFlagyl for aspiration pneumonia which would be continued for\n10-14 days. By postoperative day #5 , it was clear that this was\na problem of drug or alcohol withdrawal at least that was what\nwas thought. Her neuro regimen was changing at this time with\nvarious measures using Versed , then using Ativan , and Apresodex\nto changing her fentanyl regimen as well as adding morphine to\nher regimen p.r.n. all with goals of increasing the general\nrelaxation. Psych was consulted on postoperative day #5 and\nconcluded that this woman had a history of polysubstance abuse ,\nalcohol and likely opiates , and chronic abdominal pain due to\nstricture which probably was related to her opioid abuse; I\nbelieve the delirium was likely multifactorial in etiology ,\npostoperative delirium that was notable for significant fluid\nshifts , there was the question of aspiration pneumonia in\naddition to possible opiate and alcohol withdrawal. They\nrecommended starting with Zyprexa if the patient was sedated in\nthe a.m. with a DC a.m. dose of Zyprexa and just use it in the\nevening and agreed to taper off the Versed minimizing the use of\nopiates as tolerated by the patient and encouraged the family to\nreorient the patient to keep her awake during the day. On\npostoperative day #6 , her mental status was gradually clearing.\nPatient goal was to wean off sedation for a possible extubation.\nHer blood pressure as well as heart rate were stabilizing and\ntube feeds were also started at this point with multivitamins and\nmineral replacement. In addition , urine output continued to be\ngood. Her hematocrit was stable. Her cultures were at this\npoint negative , but the antibiotic Flagyl-levo regimen was\ncontinued. Of note , her stoma would gradually start to produce\nfluid and her incision during this leg of her course remained\nclean , dry , and intact. On postoperative day #6 , she was also\nconsulted by Addiction Psychiatry who concluded similar results\nto recommendations concluded earlier. They would agree with the\nZyprexa and also recommended restarting Ativan , as I said ,\nadditionally agreeing with the taper off of the Versed with the\nuse of Ativan only for cases of agitation and additionally\nrecommended to the discontinue the Celexa and BuSpar the patient\nwas on until the delirium cleared to avoid a polypharmacy. Of\nnote , Psyche was able to speak with the husband who confirmed the\npatient's longstanding history of alcohol dependence that likely\npredated the 10 years that he had known her. It is important to\nnote that the patient was consuming approximately a quart of\nVodka a day as well as Peppermint Schnapps daily up until her\nsurgery last April . After that procedure , she continued to\ndrink presumably about 3 beers a day. However , the husband since\nhe was working so much was unable to really adequately guage just\nhow much alcohol she was drinking. In addition , she was noted to\nhave , this is per the husband , undergone multiple detoxes at\ntreatment facilities for alcohol dependence and believed that she\nhad experience withdrawal seizures in the past. On postoperative\nday #7 , the patient's mental status was gradually improving with\nweaning off of her Versed with IV Ativan and low doses as\ntolerated and p.r.n. She , in addition , this day was tolerating\nher tube feeds; however , she did pull her NG tube again. Her Foley\nwas taken out at this time. The ureteral injury believed to be\nresolved at this point , continued on her levo and Flagyl with\nquestion of whether or not to stop her antibiotic regimen. On\npostoperative day #8 , mental status continued to improve and she\nwas started on sips which she tolerated well. Her IV was hep\nlocked and she was seen fit to be transferred to the floor. Of\nnote , also on postoperative day #8 , the patient had some low\nblood pressure which was treated with volume resuscitation in the\nform of normal saline boluses that stabilized right after her\ntransfer to the floor. On postoperative day #9 , it was noted\nthat the patient had some red stool in the ostomy bag. The\npatient was hemodynamically stable this was afternoon of\npostoperative day #9. Her labs were checked , CBC , and found to\nbe within normal limits and her ibuprofen which she was taking\nwas discontinued. On postoperative day #10 , with mental status\nimproving greatly , the patient had her central line discontinued.\nOver the last couple of days , she had made attempts to walk and\nwas walking with PT. Her diet over the last couple of days had\nbeen advanced without any problems and she was converted to a\nhouse diet on postoperative day #10. On postoperative day #11 ,\nher mental status seemingly completely resolved on regular diet ,\nout of bed. It was noted though that she had some erythema of\nthe mid portion of her wound , three staples were removed from\nthis portion of the wound and serosanguinous exudate was\nexpressed , minimal amount of fluid. The wound was explored and\nthere was found to be no fascial defect. Cultures were taken at\nthis time and the wound was packed with wet-to-dry dressing with\ninstructions given to the patient and nursing for wet-to-dry\ndressing changes t.i.d. On postoperative day #11 , the patient\nwas seen fit to be discharged home. Her mental status had\ncompletely resolved. She was afebrile and hemodynamically\nstable , tolerating a regular diet , and fully ambulatory. She was\nto be discharged home with VNA Services. Medicine Team that had\nbeen seeing her did agree that she needed to contact her\npsychiatrist to provide an update of the current admission to\nupdate her on her medical regimen inhouse and she is to schedule\nan appointment to follow up with her psychiatrist. The Medicine\nTeam also recommended continuing her psyche medications she was\ntaking prior to admission that includes Celexa 4 mg q.d. , BuSpar\n10 mg t.i.d. , nortriptyline will be started by her psychiatrist.\nAlso recommended to continue Ativan taper as followed with 1 mg\nt.i.d. today , 1 mg b.i.d. the next day which would have been\n5/29 , and then 1 mg q.a.m. on Wednesday 6/26, and then stop\ntaking the Ativan with instructions of no refills on the Ativan.\nThe Medicine Team also strongly enforced , reminded her not to\ndrink while taking the Ativan.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-9": "HOSPITAL COURSE  1 ) Cardiovascular\nclinically volume overloaded. He was diuresed\nwith torsemide IV boluses with good response. He was diuresing two\nliters negative per day on torsemide IV or p.o. as well as\nspironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. However , his clinical volume status\nwere difficult to assess and accordingly on 8/12/02 he underwent\nright heart catheterization and tailored therapy. By report his\nright atrial pressure on right heart catheterization was 17 , his\nwedge pressure was 43 and pulmonary artery pressure was 65/37\nindicating that he still has substantial volume overload. On\ntherapy his vasodilators were cautiously added to decrease his\nsystemic vascular resistance and total vascular resistance with\nsuccess with low doses of Captopril. His PA catheter was\ndiscontinued on 6/24/02. He has continued to be diuresed with\ntorsemide 10 p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. He should\nbe at or near euvolemia on 11/10/02 and he was discharged on a\ndiuretic regimen of torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and spironolactone\n25 mg p.o.q.d. in addition to Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.\nIschemia: There were no ischemic issues during this hospital\nadmission.\nRhythm: Electrocardiogram with first degree AV block. The patient\nwas monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital course. No\nevidence of significant arrhythmias were noted. No further workup\nwas pursued from a rhythm standpoint.\n2 ) Endocrine: The patient had a history of hypothyroidism. It is\nunclear how this came to be but at some point in the past his\nSynthroid had been stopped and only relatively recently restarted.\nHe had been maintained at a dose of 225 mcg q.d. in the past. When\nhe was restarted on Synthroid by the outpatient endocrinologist ,\nDr. Escudero , his Synthroid was started at a relatively low dose and\ntitrated slowly upwards because of his severe cardiomyopathy and\nthere was concern that increasing his dose too quickly would\nprecipitate angina. On admission his TSH was 50 and after some\ndiscussion with Dr. Pimpare his Synthroid was increased to 125 mcg\np.o.q.d. On 9/22/02 an endocrine consult was requested because on\n7/30/02 his repeat TSH of 75.8 , T4 of 6.5 and a THBR of 1.10.\nEndocrine consult recommended increasing Synthroid to 150 mcg\np.o.q.d. and slowly titrating Synthroid upwards by no more than 25\nmcg q. 3-4 weeks to a goal of 200 mcg per day , again slowly\ntitrating upwards to reduce the risk of precipitating angina.\nFurther management of his hypothyroidism could be done on an\noutpatient basis.\nThe patient also on admission had a history of Type II diabetes\nmaintained on insulin. His insulin doses had been titrated\ndownwards during his hospital diabetes mellitus because of low\nfingersticks , likely secondary to a relatively healthy diet while\nin the hospital. He required only 60 units of Lantus insulin q.\na.m. He was discharged on that dose with Humalog 10 units subcu q.\na.m. and q. p.m. to be followed and possibly titrated back upwards\nby his outpatient endocrinologist , Dr. Wakeham\n3 ) Psychiatric: The patient had a history of depression and\nduring this admission he was maintained on his outpatient\nmedications of Prozac and Restoril. His Prozac dose was titrated\nupwards to 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. without any notable side effects. He\nwas discharged on this dose , 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. No further\npsychiatric evaluation or interventions were required during his\ninpatient stay. His mood remained stable during this admission.\n4 ) Renal: The patient's creatinine was monitored throughout his\nhospital course remaining relatively stable despite diuresis. No\nfurther renal evaluation or intervention was required during this\nhospital stay.",

This was no\nsignificant change from EKG that was done on 2/3/05 .  Lower\nextremity ultrasound on 10/21/05 showed left popliteal vein\nthrombosis.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM-14": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM \n1. Cardiovascular: The patient had troponin elevations during\nthis hospitalization , the highest being 0.8. This was initially\nthought to be consistent with a non ST elevation. However ,\npatient had no EKG changes. It was also noted that the patient\nhad similar elevations of her troponin and was recently admitted\nto an outside hospital. She was initially continued on cardiac\nregimen of aspirin , Plavix , and Lopressor. On 10/21/05 , the\npatient had an episode of hypotension with systolic blood\npressure in the 30s of unknown etiology. She was given IV\nfluids , dexamethasone 4 mg and one dose of gentamicin and\nvancomycin for presumed sepsis. A bedside echo that was done\nshowed severe tricuspid regurgitation , diastolic dysfunction and\nejection fraction of 40% and pulmonary pressures in the 60s.\nThere were wall motion abnormalities that were noted. The\npatient was given additional doses of intravenous fluids and her\nblood pressures came back to 120s-130s/60s-70s. At this point ,\nthe etiology of her low blood pressure was still unknown. On\n2/16 , patient was again unresponsive with low blood pressure and\nno pulse. Code was called and the patient awoke after few chest\ncompressions was done and had a blood pressure of 130s/70s. She\nwas subsequently seen by Dr. Eugenio Krucker , cardiologist at Camp Memorial Hospital , who thought her overall picture and\nechocardiogram was consistent with cardiac amyloidosis. The\npatient was thought to have autonomic insufficiency secondary to\namyloid neuropathy and a fixed cardiac output with restrictive\nheart. Serum protein analysis subsequently revealed a\npredominance of IgG light chains with elevation of both kappa and\nlambda light change , which are suggestive but not confirmatory of\ntype AL amyloidosis. A fat pad biopsy was also done , results\nwere pending at discharge. Further blood samples were sent to\nPerli Medical Center for further\nanalysis. The patient will obtain results via her primary care\nphysician , Dr. Emanuel Chuh . Of note , the patient had no\nfurther hypotensive episodes prior to discharge.\n2. Hematology: The patient was noted to have a low platelet\ncount of 136 , 000 at admission. It was thought that this could\nbe due to possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but the hep\nantibody was negative. On 4/30/05 , lower extremity ultrasound\ndone after first episode of being unresponsive was positive for\nleft popliteal vein thrombosis. The patient was started on\nheparin intravenous according to protocol. On 10/12/05 , the\npatient had nosebleeds and hematuria and her PTT was noted to be\ngreater than 150. Heparin was stopped until the PTT was between\n60 and 80. The bleeding stopped. She was continued on heparin\nand her PTT was maintained between 60 and 80. She was later\nswitched to Lovenox and Coumadin maintaining her INR between 2\nand 3. Lovenox was discontinued and on discharge the patient was\njust on Coumadin. Her discharge INR was 2.4.\n3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with\nbaseline creatinine of 2.5. A Foley was placed at admission for\npatient comfort. She consistently had low urine output during\nher hospitalization , averaging about 300-400 cc of urine a day\neven after IV fluid administration. She had two days of\nhematuria secondary to anticoagulation that resolved after\ncopious irrigation of the Foley. Her creatinine at discharge was\n2.7. There were no acute renal issues.\n4. Pulmonary: The patient required oxygen throughout her stay\nto keep her saturations above 95%. She had a few episodes of\nshortness of breath , which spontaneously resolved. She was given\na few doses of IV Lasix and this helped a little with her\nshortness of breath , but her chest x-ray remained unchanged from\nadmission.\n5. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. She had\nnormal fingersticks during her hospitalization. She was on a\ntight glycemic control with a regular insulin sliding scale.\n6. Neuro: The patient was on aspirin and Plavix initially given\nher history of CVAs and cortical blindness , but on discharge , she\nwas on Coumadin for anticoagulation. The patient also had a\nlidocaine patch that was applied for 12 hours every day and\noxycodone was used p.r.n. pain.\n7. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient received IV\nfluid boluses during hypotensive episodes. Electrolytes were\nfollowed and repeated accordingly. Nutrition was consulted and\nshe was placed on a soft pureed diet with a 2-L fluid\nrestriction , no concentrated sweets. She was also given Nepro\nsupplements given her renal function.\n8. Line: The patient initially had an EJ line , then a femoral\nline for access as peripheral access was difficult to obtain.\nShe then had a PICC line placed on 1/22/05 for access.\n9. Disposition: There was a family meeting on 1/22/05 during\nwhich the patient's poor prognosis was discussed with Ms. Vernon B Corippo , the patient's daughter. The family emphasized that her\ncode status was DNR/DNI and they were comfortable with the\ndischarge back to Ge Er Derd .

The patient did well until July of 1995 when\nthe patient had another anterior MI , massive , treated with\nthrombolytics. Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed a 99%\nproximal RCA and serial 70% LAD lesions. The patient also was\nnoted to have a severe LV dysfunction with an ejection fraction of\n28% and his MI was complicated by a complete heart block and a dual\nchamber pacemaker was placed. At that time the patient was\nconsidered to be a surgical candidate secondary to high risk. In\nAugust of 1995 the patient was admitted for non Q wave MI with a\npeak CK of 798 , positive MB fraction , and was again treated with\nthrombolysis with TPA. The patient did well with no anginal\nsymptoms but has had primarily symptoms of CHF with dyspnea upon\nexertion , progressive shortness of breath , and limited exercise\ntolerance since that time. In July of 1996 the patient had an\nexercise tolerance test with oxygen consumption measured at 11.8\nml/kg.

In\n6/28 , she presented to Good Niton Community Hospital with history of\nprogressive dyspnea and congestive heart failure noted at an\noutside hospital. Ejection fraction at that time on echo was 18% ,\nwith severe MR and TR. She was admitted and an echo done at the\nCo.wer Hospital Medical Center showed moderate left ventricular dilatation with an EF of\n25-30% , with only mild regional variability. There was also right\nventricular dilatation with mild decrease in function. Mitral\nvalve was thickened with severe MI. CAT at that time showed 71%\nleft-sided lesion. The patient underwent , in 6/28 , mitral valve\nrepair and one-vessel CABG lemma to the LAD. She had an uneventful\npost-op course. Her post-op echo on 6/12/95 revealed LV\ndilatation with clear EF of 23% and good IV function. Moderate\nresidual mitral regurgitation and moderate TR. Post-op weight of\nthe patient was 177 lb.\nPost-operatively , the patient did well initially , when she had PND\nand orthopnea that was marked prior to surgery , she is able to walk\nnow , and when she was only able to walk only 40 ft. before\nstopping. She now sleeps flat on her bed with improved exercise\ntolerance. She experiences near total resolution of the PND and\northopnea initially. However , in the period between 6/28 to\n7/30 , the above symptoms recurred with progressive shortness of\nbreath , dyspnea on exertion , cough and positional chest pains. On\n3/13/95 , the patient saw her physician and was noted to have a\nlarge left pleural effusion at an outside hospital. A left\nthoracentesis was done. Patient noted 1 liter of bloody fluid that\nwas tapped from her thoracentesis. Post-procedural weight was 169\nlb. She was able to breath more easily.\nStatus post the left thoracentesis , the patient initially felt\nwell. However , within the next few days , she continued to develop\nworsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion , as well as\nPND and orthopnea. She , therefore , represents on 1/2/96 for\nrecurrence of her symptoms and recurrence of left pleural effusion.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE  Ms. Franz was initially admitted with a\ndiagnosis of left pleural effusion of unclear\netiology. A left thoracentesis was performed and the fluid was\ndeemed exudative. It was bloody in appearance and had a white\ncount greater than 4 , 000 , with a red cell count greater than\n500 , 000. Patient met criteria for exudative fluid by\nfluid-serum-LDH ratios , fluid-serum-protein ratio and LDH greater\nthan 200. Subsequent cultures , however , were negative for a\nbacterial fungal AFB. Rheumatology etiologies were also R/O with\nnegative ANA and negative rheumatoid factor. Cytology was sent on\nthe patient , which also returned negative for malignant cells. A\ntotal of 1.5 liters was drained from the thoracentesis. Subsequent\nto the thoracentesis , the patient felt significantly better , with\nbetter exercise tolerance and less orthopnea. She remains with RAO\nto sats greater than 95% for the remainder of her hospitalization\nand did not require oxygen. A repeat chest x-ray was done prior to\ndischarge , and compared to post-thoracentesis , showed no\nsignificant accumulation of the left pleural effusion.\nInitially it was felt that the patient's symptoms might have some\nrelationship to some element of congestive heart failure. She was\nstarted on Digoxin and Captopril and maxed at Digoxin .25 q day and\nCaptopril 50 mg t.i.d. During this hospitalization , however , the\npatient noted in passing , that she had , since her 6/28 surgery ,\ndeveloped significant dizziness and orthostatic symptoms upon\nsitting up and rising , and had limited exercise tolerance partly\nbecause of shortness of breath , but also partly because of her\ndizziness symptoms. She noted occasional vertigo and occasional\ndiplopia. A work-up subsequently ensued related to the symptoms.\nNeurology was consulted and carotid Dopplers , as well as MRA of the\nhead to R/O vertebral basal insufficiency were performed. Both\ncarotid Dopplers revealed less than 25 stenosis bilaterally and MRA\nof the head revealed no vertebral basal insufficiency. However , it\nwas noted on repeated measurements of the patient's blood\npressures , that when she sat up and when she stood up , she became\nhypotensive. A modified Bruce protocol stress test was performed\nto determine the patient's exercise tolerance. Prior to initiation\nof the modified Bruce , supine blood pressure was 120/80. Upon\nsitting up , the patient's blood pressure was 92 and upon beginning\nthe modified Bruce within less than one minute , the patient's blood\npressure dipped to 60 systolic , and test was terminated. An\nechocardiogram during this admission revealed an ejection fraction\nof 30% , moderate LV dilatation , severe global hyperkinesis ,\npreserved right ventricular function and size , and only trivial MR\nand TR. No significant arrhythmias were noted on the patient's\ncardiac monitor throughout her hospitalization , except for one\nepisode of transient third degree heart block with a ventricular\nrhythm. The patient did not demonstrate this rhythm consistently ,\nhowever , during her hypertensive episodes.\nOn review of the patient's past medical history , however , it was\nfound that the patient had been on chronic steroids for two years\nprior to her 6/28 CABG and prior to the onset of these symptoms of\northostasis and dizziness. Patient notes that she was more on than\noff on p.o. steroids for treatment of her shortness of breath at an\noutside hospital in Perv Rome Voraso , Nevada 15117 At that time , they had deemed that her\nshortness of breath symptoms were secondary to pulmonary etiologies\nrather than cardiac. We , therefore , suspected adrenal\ninsufficiency and consulted endocrine. ACTH stem test was\nperformed and Cortisol , Adolsterone and ACTH levels were drawn at\n0:30 and 60 minutes post-administration of ACTH. The patient\ndeveloped hives and angioedema with the ACTH which was relieved\nwith Benadryl IV. After the performance of the ACTH stem test\nempirically started on Hydrocortisone 80 mg IV. The next day the\npatient's symptoms resolved and she no longer had any evidence of\northostatic hypertension or dizziness symptoms related to standing\nor walking. Repeated blood pressure measurements for orthostatic\nwere unyielding. The patient noted her symptoms are completely\nresolved and that she felt like a different person. It was ,\ntherefore , felt that the empiric trial of hydrocortisone was\nsignificant and that the patient most likely had adrenal\ninsufficiency secondary to chronic steroid for the two years prior\nto the 6/28 CABG , and this was consistent with the time closer to\npatient's symptoms , which began after the 6/28 CABG when she was\noff steroids.\nThe patient was therefore discharged in stable condition with\ndiagnosis of a left pleural effusion secondary to most likely a\npost-pericardiotomy syndrome , as well as orthostatic hypertension\nand dizziness symptoms secondary to adrenal insufficiency. At the\ntime of discharge , the patient's ACTH stem test was still pending ,\nas well as the TSH. It was felt at the time of discharge , the\npatient should not be managed on Captopril or Digoxin. It remained\nunclear whether or not the patient's current ejection fraction was\nadequate for her symptoms.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE  1 ) Pulmonary\non 21 of September to the Short Stay Unit as stated in\nthe history of present illness and received one dose of Solu-Medrol\nintravenously in the Emergency Department and then started on\nPrednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d. She was also placed on Atrovent and\nAlbuterol nebulizers. The patient noted slow improvement in\nsymptoms , as well as peak flows. Peak flow initially on admission\nwas around 200 and on transfer from the Short Stay Unit was about\n250. Once the patient was transferred to the floor , she had noted\nsignificant improvement , requiring decreased 02 , essentially to\nrequire no 02 on 11 of April with an 02 saturation of 96%. The\npatient was changed to metered dose inhalers with Aerochamber on\n11 of April which consisted of Serevent two puffs b.i.d. , Vanceril\nfour puffs b.i.d. , and Albuterol two puffs q.i.d. , with noted\nimprovement. The patient was also continued on 40 mg of Prednisone\np.o. q.d. , as well as Augmentin for question of bronchitis. On\n26 of July the patient was found to have slight scattered end\nexpiratory wheezes , however , was moving good air. It was decided\nto discharge the patient from a pulmonary standpoint on Vanceril\nfour puffs b.i.d. , Serevent two puffs b.i.d. , and Albuterol two\npuffs q.i.d. for seven days , then p.r.n. The patient's peak flow\non the day of discharge was approximately 250 as well , however ,\nnotable symptomatic improvement was achieved. The patient is to\nfollow-up with Dr. Ledee in one week.\n2 ) Left great toe cellulitis. An infectious disease consult was\nobtained , and it was felt that bone films would be in order to rule\nout any evidence of chronic osteomyelitis as well as to continue\non Augmentin 250 mg t.i.d. Bone films were obtained which were\nnegative for any evidence of chronic osteomyelitis. Subsequently ,\nESR was checked which was elevated at 73. As well , a bone scan\nobtained to rule out chronic osteomyelitis of the left great toe ,\nthe results of which on the preliminary reading were as follows.\nThe right foot was diffusely hyperemic. The left foot potentially\ncould be underperfused in relation to the right foot secondary to\ndiabetic vascular changes. On the delayed images , the right second\nproximal phalanx had a slight prominence. The left second\nmetatarsophalangeal joint had a slight prominence. She also\ndemonstrated an abnormal right mid foot at the proximal\nmetatarsophalangeal joints of the medial three metatarsals ,\npossibly consistent with neuropathic joint. There was also a\nprominence of bilateral tibial components of the knees which could\nbe suggestive of prosthetic loosening , however , this was not\nconfirmed by clinical exam. In essence , there was no evidence of\nchronic osteomyelitic changes. Therefore , it was decided to\ncontinue a total of a 14 day course of Augmentin 250 mg t.i.d.\nfor this issue. If symptoms were to worsen or not improve fully ,\nthe patient is to follow-up again with her primary medical doctors ,\nDr. Tomkus or Dr. Lesesne , as well as potentially setting her up in\nthe Infectious Disease Clinic for further follow-up.\n3 ) Miscellaneous. As to the remainder of her medical issues , the\npatient was maintained on her home medications and demonstrated no\nissues. Therefore , the patient was discharged on 26 of July in\nstable condition.\nFOLLOW-UP: The patient is to make an appointment and follow-up\nwith Dr. Alls for her chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease/asthma flare. She is also to follow-up with Dr. Liddicoat in\nthree weeks to one month for her endocrinologic issues.

She was\ntransferred to the Cardiac Surgery Step Down Unit on\npostoperative day #1 , where diuresis was increased. Baby aspirin\nwas begun , and the patient continued to make excellent\ncardiovascular progress. On February , 2003 , she began to\ncomplain of some persistent numbness and tingling of the left\nlower extremity , which she felt to be interrupting her attempts\nto stand and maintain balance. For further treatment , a\nNeurology consult was obtained. Per Neurology , she was found to\nhave no weakness at the left lower leg and foot , although when\npressure was exerted on the foot , she reported an uncomfortable\ntingling throughout the leg. She reported no back pain and no\nchange in bowel or bladder control. Sensory examination was\nfound to be intact , however , soft touch and pin sensation tested\nin the lateral leg below the knee caused a spreading tingling\nsensation throughout the left lower extremity. Per Neurology\nrecommendations , Neurontin 300 mg q.d. was begun and it was\nrecommended that she follow up with the Department of Neurology\nfollowing discharge if the tingling sensation has not improved.\nWith aggressive diuresis , the patient was able to regain her\npostoperative weight and by the day of discharge was 1.7\nkilograms below her preoperative weight. She has made excellent\ncardiovascular progress following this surgery and is anticipated\nto continue her rehabilitation at home with VNA System.",

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-1": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 76 year old woman who\nhad a two vessel coronary artery\nbypass graft on 3/10/97. She was discharged to home on 5/4/97 to\nDiand Leb Hospital Hospital And Hospital where she developed\nepigastric discomfort and recurrent atrial fibrillation and was\ntransferred back to Landso Souwalt Medical Center .\nHer cardiac history dates back to October of 1995 when she was\nadmitted to Kassi Rehabilitation Hospital for an asthma flare. At that\ntime she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Her CKs were\nnegative. An exercise test at that time showed she was able to go\neight minutes on a Bruce protocol with 2 mm ST depressions in leads\n2 , 3 , and F. A MIBI showed a small reversible defect inferiorly\nand she was managed medically at that time.\nIn February of 1996 she was again admitted to Lita Hospital with chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial\ninfarction. She was started on Prilosec for presumed\ngastroesophageal reflux disease. In September of 1996 an exercise\nThallium test showed she went eight minutes on a Bruce protocol\nwith a heart rate of 125 , blood pressure 170/80 , and no ECG\nchanges. She stopped secondary to chest pain.\nFrom 3/30/97 through 3/5/97 she presented with chest pressure at\nrest which radiated to her shoulders and jaw. On presentation she\nwas noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation. An ECG at that time\nshowed elevated T-waves in V1 and V2. She was treated with\nLopressor with slowing of the rate and relief of her chest pain.\nShe ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 473 with\nan MB fraction of 32. Her Lopressor was changed to Verapamil\nsecondary to increased wheezing requiring nebulizers. The patient\nunderwent a cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed\nan left anterior descending artery that had 70% proximal lesion\nwith collaterals , left circumflex artery with long 80 to 90%\nstenosis , right coronary artery 30 to 40% stenosis , left ventricle\nwith ejection fraction of 58% , and apical akinesis. She\nspontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm. Following\ncatheterization the patient agreed to a coronary artery bypass\ngraft but the procedure was postponed until she received Epogen\ntherapy since she is a Jehovah's Witness. She was discharged in\nsinus rhythm.\nShe returned on 10/17/97 and underwent a coronary artery bypass\ngraft times two which was complicated by a perioperative myocardial\ninfarction with inferior ST elevations and peak CK of 386 and MB\nfraction of 8.1. Atrial fibrillation was not controlled with\nVerapamil. The patient was loaded on Digoxin and had multiple\nepisodes of atrial fibrillation. She converted to normal sinus\nrhythm and was discharged to rehabilitation on 5/4/97 in normal\nsinus rhythm.\nHer postoperative course was notable for gastrointestinal distress\nwith epigastric burning , reflux , nausea , vomiting , and\nconstipation. On 5/4/97 at rehabilitation the patient noted\nworsening epigastric burning with a sour taste in her mouth. This\nwas relieved with Maalox. She was awakened from sleep with\nepigastric burning radiating to the right back and palpitations.\nECG showed rapid atrial fibrillation at a rate of 125 to 150 and\nshe was treated with Verapamil 2.5 mg IV times two and converted to\nnormal sinus rhythm. The patient was noted to have ST elevations\nof 1 mm in 1 , 3 , and F and she was transferred to Yacull Hospital for further evaluation. She had no complaint of shortness\nof breath , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , syncope , or\npresyncope. At Vero Medical Center she was noted to have\nepigastric burning similar to a prior episode and was treated with\nMaalox with relief.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-2": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  She was lying in bed in no apparent\ndistress. HEENT: Normocephalic ,\natraumatic. Pupils equal , round , and reactive to light and\naccommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx benign.\nNeck: Supple. Full range of motion. No lymphadenopathy.\nCarotids 2+ without bruits. JVP 8 cm. Heart: No heave and no\nthrill. Regular rate. S1 , split S2. 2/6 systolic murmur at apex.\nPositive for frictional rub. Lungs clear to auscultation. No\nwheeze or rhonchi. Chest had midline sternotomy without any\nexudate or erythema. Sternum was stable. Back: No costovertebral\nangle tenderness. Abdomen: Keloid in right upper quadrant. Soft ,\nnontender , nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: No\nclubbing , cyanosis , or edema. Neurologic: Alert and oriented\ntimes three. Cranial nerves II - XII intact. Intact sensation and\nstrength throughout. Reflexes symmetric and toes downgoing.",
        "LABORATORY DATA-3": "LABORATORY DATA  Sodium 129 , potassium 5.4 , creatinine 1.0 , BUN\n20 , glucose 227. Digoxin level 2.6. Hematocrit\n45.1 , WBC 9.2. Her triponin-1 level was 0.7. ECG at Aifield Sum Taning Healthcare Center was in normal sinus rhythm. Normal left axis ,\nnormal intervals. 0.16 , 0.88 , 0.36. Rate of 85. Left atrial\nenlargement. 1 mm ST depressions in 1 and 2 which is consistent\nwith Digoxin effect. 1 mm upsloping ST elevations in 2 , 3 , and F\nunchanged from prior ECG on 8/28/97. Chest x-ray showed mediastinal\nshadow. Stable with question of atelectasis at left base.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-4": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction\nand her chest burning was primarily due to\ngastrointestinal reflux which was relieved with Maalox , as well as\nchest discomfort in her left shoulder which was due to\nmusculoskeletal pain and was relieved with Tylenol and Percocet or\nDarvocet. On monitor she showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation\nalthough she did have supraventricular tachycardia and one incident\nof a ten-beat run. In light of the fact that the patient is a\nJehovah's Witness and is not a candidate for being Coumadinized for\nepisodes of rapid atrial fibrillation , it was felt that we would\nuse the anti-arrhythmic agent , Propafenone , to prevent episodes in\nthe perioperative period of atrial fibrillation. Her Digoxin was\ndiscontinued and she tolerated Propafenone load of 150 mg t.i.d.\nwell along with her Verapamil dose.\nOther issues during this admission were that her blood sugar was\nhigh requiring sliding scale of insulin. Also the patient had\nhyponatremia with sodium in the high 120s and low 130s throughout\nher stay , as well as a potassium which was mildly elevated , ranging\nfrom 5.0 to 5.8. Cortisol levels were drawn and results are\npending for possibility of adrenal insufficiency. The question of\na renal tubular acidosis type IV was raised.\nThroughout the admission her chest burning was well controlled with\nMaalox. Her Pepcid dose was increased to 20 mg b.i.d.\nHelicobacter pylori and IgG antibodies were sent and results are\npending. Her musculoskeletal pain which is primarily in her left\nshoulder radiating to her arm has been well controlled with\nTylenol.",

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-2": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  This is a 53-year-old woman with mild\nmental retardation , schizophrenia , and\nborderline diabetes mellitus who was transferred from Himend Richdent Health Services for further cardiac evaluation after a non Q wave\nmyocardial infarction. She was in her usual state of health until\nAugust 1995 when her family reports she began to have\nintermittent abdominal pain and shortness of breath. It continued\nto worsen until October 1996 when she presented to her primary\nmedical doctor and was diagnosed with a upper respiratory infection\nand treated with antibiotics and Theo-Dur. At that time , the\nfamily noticed she had an increasing shortness of breath , lethargy ,\nand now significant weight gain. They reported about 35 lb per\nweek. On the date of admission to the Limen Hospital , she was\nambulating , but became extremely short of breath with severe\nabdominal pain. They took her to the hospital and she was admitted\nfor what they thought was primary gastrointestinal process , but\nthey noted increasing GGTs without alkaline phosphatase changes in\nher laboratory panel. She was placed on a rule out myocardial\ninfarction protocol and subsequently ruled in for a non Q wave\nmyocardial infarction with CKs of 235 , 6.3% , 246 , 7.7% MBs and 197 ,\n7.6% MBs. Her EKG showed anterolateral myocardial\ninfarction/ischemic myocardial infarction. Her echo at Woodnaw Medical Center showed decreased LV function per report. Since admission\nthere , she had had repeated episodes of chest pain/abdominal\ndiscomfort from 7/11/96 to 5/25/96 , and she was transferred to\nthe Middvail Fredhot Hospital for further evaluation.",

        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-5": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  The patient is an obese woman in no obvious\ndistress. The patient had dry mucous\nmembranes. Her neck and JVP were difficult to assess secondary to\nbody habitus. She had a left IJ catheter in place. She had\ndistant heart sounds without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Lungs had\ncrackles 1/4 of the way up bilaterally. Abdomen was markedly obese\nwith a right upper quadrant tenderness to deep palpation. She had\nedema from her feet up to her abdominal canis. She had 4+ edema to\nher hips. There were 2+ pulses DP and PT. Femoral pulses were\ndifficult to assess. The patient was alert and oriented times\nthree and able to understand questions , but she had decreased\nverbal skills.",
        "LABORATORY DATA-6": "LABORATORY DATA  SMA-20 and CBC were within normal range. Her\nLDH was slightly elevated at 419 , alkaline\nphosphatase elevated at 746. Total protein was decreased at 6.4 ,\nalbumin decreased at 3.6. Her digoxin level was 0.4. She was on\nheparin with a PTT of 58.8. EKG showed a sinus rhythm of 89 , poor\nR wave progression , old ischemic myocardial infarction , T wave\ninversions in 1 , L , and V5-V6. Chest x-ray , by report from Noxer Kingsnew Tesbucks Health Of , showed mild cardiomegaly , pulmonary venous\nhypertension , elevated right hemidiaphragm.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "HOSPITAL COURSE  On transfer , the patient was evaluated with an\nechocardiogram which showed global hypokinesis\nwith an ejection fraction of 20% and severely dilated heart.\nCardiac catheterization was contemplated to rule out ischemia as\nher source of cardiomyopathy , but given that catheterization would\nlikely require intubation secondary to sedation given her psych\nissues , the decision was made to pursue a more conservative course\nwith treatment of medication. She was aggressively treated for\ncongestive heart failure with digoxin , Ace inhibitor , and IV Lasix\nand she continued to get IV Lasix b.i.d. 40 mg. She remained\nstable while in the hospital and , after several days of diuresis ,\nher edema slowly improved. Her breathing improved and she began to\nambulate. She lost approximately 8 kg while in hospital.\nHer second issue was gastrointestinal. She continued to have , on\nadmission , an elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase in the absence\nof significant transaminases , it was not consistent with passive\ncongestion alone. We continued to follow them and they eventually\ndrifted down. The source of her elevations were never clear. We\nchecked the ammonia level which was normal and a sedimentation rate\nwhich was normal.\nHer third issue was Infectious Disease. Her urine , by report at\nYmont Taplaeast Hospital , had greater than 10-15 E.coli. She was not\ntreated with antibiotics. We repeated the urinalysis here and\nbegan ampicillin on p.o. for a urinary tract infection , which she\ncontinued for a full 10 day course. They felt that her urinary\ntract infection was secondary to limited ambulation and her body\nhabitus.\nThe fourth issue was fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition. She had\ntotal body edema and anasarca with slightly decreased protein and\nalbumin , but most likely secondary to severe congestive heart\nfailure. Her mucous membranes were dry , but felt this was\nsecondary to her breathing and possible intervascular depletion.\nAll of these issues cleared as she was diuresed.\nThe fifth issue was psych. We continued her medications and\ncontacted her family for support while she was in the hospital.\nThe patient did well and once she was able to walk around with\nphysical therapy , she was discharged on Lasix , digoxin , and with\nVNA.",

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-5": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient , Mr. Genuario is a\n44-year-old married Hispanic male with a history of diabetes;\nhypertension; hypercholesterolemia; and obstructive sleep apnea ,\non CPAP , who presented to the Ryans Valley Hospital Emergency Room on November ,\n2005 , with complaint of shortness of breath. His wife reported\nthat he has been experiencing gradually worsening shortness of\nbreath since the afternoon of October , 2005 , without any chest\npain. He has increased dyspnea on exertion , needing to use a\nCPAP at night. He was found to be hypertensive to the 200/100 ,\nwith florid pulmonary edema and hypertensive encephalopathy. The\npatient was then intubated for airway protection and oxygenation\nand admitted to the R.f. Hospital ICU where he was diuresed\naggressively. The patient's hypertension was difficult to\ncontrol , requiring labetalol initially and then a successful\nregimen of IV nitroglycerin , nitroprusside , hydralazine , and\nLopressor. The patient received a TEE on November , 2005 , which\nshowed concentric LVH , no wall motion abnormalities , and EF of\n45%. There was a concern for aortic dissection on\nechocardiogram , but an MRI/MRA revealed no dissection. The\npatient was also frequently agitated requiring increasing doses\nof Versed and fentanyl as well as p.r.n. Haldol and Zyprexa.\nDuring the admission to Nymo Hospital , he had lateral ST segment\ndepressions on multiple EKGs and a non-ST-elevation MI ( NSTEMI )\nwith a peak troponin of 20 on November , 2005 , a peak CK of 430 ,\nand a peak MB of 20. He was started on ASA , heparin ,\nbeta-blocker , statin , and Integrilin and transferred to the IH\non March , 2005 , for management for possible catheterization.\nAt the Mancharl Tuvange Memorial Hospital ICU , the patient also had marked hyperglycemia\nand was put on a ??___?? protocol.\nAt the Ston N CCU , he was found to have a cardiac enzyme leak\nwith a peak CK of 286 , CK-MB of 6.2 , and troponin of 13.8 , which\ntrended down. His EKG showed signs of evolving anterior MI. The\npatient was continued to be maintained on aspirin , Plavix , and\nLipitor while Integrilin was discontinued on CCU day #2 as the\npatient was not stable for cardiac catheterization. His blood\npressure continued to be very difficult to control. The patient\ncame in from the PAMC with a nitroglycerin drip , which was weaned\nand transitioned to Norvasc 5 mg q.d. , captopril 25 t.i.d. ,\nLopressor 100 q.i.d. , and hydralazine 50 q.i.d. However , his\nblood pressure continued to rise ??___?? on CCU day #4 and\nNipride drip was initiated. This increase was in the setting of\nconfusion ??___??. His Nipride was weaned on day #5 and his p.o.\nblood pressure medications were restarted with systolic blood\npressure goal of 140. The patient also had an episode of sinus\npause of greater than 2.5 seconds on September , 2005 , with no\nsymptoms. IV labetalol was discontinued after that episode.\nCCU course was complicated by the patient spiking a fever to\n104.1 on CCU day #3 , and he was started on broad spectrum\nantibiotics for presumptive ICU pneumonia. He was started on\nvancomycin , ceftazidime , and levofloxacin was added. The CCU\ncourse was also complicated by the patient developing left-sided\nweakness in the left lower extremity on ICU day #5 , which was\nconcerning for CVA. An MRI/MRA was obtained which showed small\nvessel disease consistent with hypertension-induced\ncerebrovascular accident and no evidence of embolism. An\nechocardiogram was obtained and was negative for any cardiac\nsources and emboli and with a negative bubble study. Secondary\nto the patient's mental status and question of inability to\nswallow , an NG tube was placed; however , it was self-discontinued\nby the patient on September , 2005. The patient was transferred to\nthe cardiology team on January , 2005 , for further medical\nmanagement prior to cardiac catheterization for the\nnon-ST-elevation MI.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS-17": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS \n1. CV: Ischemia: EKG showing sign of an evolving anterior MI.\nThe patient continued to be on aspirin , Plavix , and Lipitor. The\npatient received a catheterization on August , 2005 , which shows\nleft oblique marginal #1 with 90% discrete lesion that was\nstented to 0 with a DES stent and RCA with 80% discrete lesion\nstented to 0. The patient was stable postcatheterization.\nPump: The patient's blood pressure continued to be high on the\nfloor. He was started on captopril 50 t.i.d. , eventually\nincreased to 100 t.i.d.; hydralazine 20 q.i.d. IV , eventually\nswitching over to 50 p.o. q.i.d. The patient was restarted on\nhome medication of clonidine patch as discontinuation can cause\nlabile hypertension. He was also started on Lasix 80 mg p.o.\nb.i.d. During the catheterization , the patient was found to have\na pulmonary wedge pressure of 17 , which is elevated. He was\ngiven IV Lasix to diurese. He diuresed very well with the p.o.\nand IV dose.\nRhythm: The patient had two episodes of sinus pause greater than\n3 seconds on September , 2005 , with no episodes since September ,\n2005. It could be secondary to obstructive sleep apnea versus\nconduction abnormality. Electrophysiology service was consulted.\nThe EP service encouraged the patient to wear a CPAP device\nduring the day. His beta-blocker was held secondary to the sinus\npause. However , after the catheterization and with the result of\nobstructive lesion , the patient was restarted on low-dose\nbeta-blocker with atenolol 25 mg q.d.\n2. Pulmonary: When transferred , the patient's sedation was\nweaned and he was without any pressure on CCU day #4. He had\nreceived Lasix for pulmonary edema. He continued to diuresed on\nthe floor with 80 mg p.o. of Lasix.\n3. ID: The patient had spiked a fever to 104.1 on March ,\n2005 , with a question of pneumonia. He was continued on his\nvancomycin , ceftazidime , and levofloxacin for a 14-day course.\nHis vancomycin will be completed on discharge while he will need\nto continue on ceftazidime and levofloxacin during\nrehabilitation. The patient was MRSA negative. He continues to\nhave low-grade fever , but no frank fever over 100.4. The patient\ncontinued to improve and does not complain of any subjective\nfever.\n4. GI: The patient received an NG tube on September , 2005 , but it\nwas self-discontinued. He had speech and swallow test , which he\npassed and was started on the house diet. The patient received a\nnutrition consult for his diabetes and was put on a cardiac and\ndiabetic diet. His magnesium and potassium were repleted.\n5. Renal: On admission , his creatinine was 1.6 and trended down\nto 1.2 and 1.1 prior to discharge. We thought that his\nincreasing creatinine is likely secondary from hypertensive\ninjury. The patient was given Mucomyst prior and after\ncatheterization. He tolerated the ACE inhibition with no rise in\ncreatinine.\n6. Neurologic: On CCU day #5 , the patient developed weakness in\nthe left upper and lower extremity with concern for CVA.\nNeurologic consult was initiated and MRI and MRA were obtained.\nMRI/MRA showed small vessel disease consistent with\nhypertension-induced CVA. He had a negative echocardiogram and\nnegative bubble study. The patient was given some physical\ntherapy and will likely need rehabilitation.\n7. Endocrine: The patient takes Humalog 75/25 50 units before\nbreakfast and 20 units before dinner , NPH 20 at bedtime , and also\nActos and metformin. Here , the patient was given a NovoLog\nsliding scale with 14 units of NovoLog q.a.c. and Lantus 35\nq.h.s. He will be continued on these doses and will need to be\ntransitioned to his home medications once he goes home.\n8. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive PPI and heparin for\nprophylaxis.",

Cardiovascular:\nIschemia: The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes.\nHer EKG was abnormal , but unchanged from 1/28 She continued on aspirin ,\nPlavix and\nLipitor. Fasting lipids did not indicate need for change in\nstatin treatment. On 3/1 , the patient had a recurrence of\nher chest pain symptoms in the setting of her only hypertensive\nevent during this admission. Her EKG was notable for new flipped\nTs in leads V3 and V4 ( which happened to be seen previously\nduring this admission when she had atrial fibrillation with rapid\nventricular response on 6/3 ). The medical team suspects\nhypertensive-induced microvascular angina. A repeat rule out MI\nhas been re-initiated and is currently in progress at the time of\nthis dictation. A&B set enzymes were negative.\nPump: Echocardiogram at the Dallnorm Community Hospital on 10/6\nrevealed normal left ventricle with an EF of 60% , left atrial\nenlargement , 1-2+ mitral valve regurgitation , 1+ tricuspid\nregurgitation , and mild pulmonary hypertension ( with pulmonary\nartery pressure of 43 ). The patient had fine rales on her admit\nexam with BNP of 160. Of note , on 10/6 at Warden Memorial Hospital the\npatient had her Lisinopril increased to 15 mg b.i.d. to facilitate\nbetter blood pressure control. ACE inhibitor and Lasix were held\nduring this admission due to arise in her creatinine. Lisinopril was\nrestarted at a dose reduction of 5 mg b.i.d. and Lasix was restarted\non 3/1 in the setting of symptomatic chest pain which began while the\npatient was receiving a second unit of blood ( see heme below of more\ndetails ). Her BNP following the transfusion was 265. The current plan\nis to titrate ACE inhibitor to affect as long as her creatinine\ndoes not climb.\nRhythm: The patient had asymptomatic sinus bradycardia with rates ranging\n45-58 until 5/3 when she had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid\nventricular response\nto 130s to 140s. She was effectively treated with\nLopressor 25mg x1 , 5 mg IV x2 , then diltiazem 10 mg x1. The patient later\nthen converted to sinus rhythm , sinus bradycardia. On 6/8 , the\npatient had a 12-22 symptomatic ventricular pause. The consulting\ncardiologist ( Dr. Siebel ) was notified of the atrial\nfibrillation and ventricular pause event. Dr. Pinet\nrecommended starting an amiodarone load which has been\nimplemented and is currently in progress. He recommended no\ninpatient EP eval this admission because the patient had no\nfurther symptomatic pauses. Dr. Selma deferring decision and\narrangements for Holter versus loop monitors to the patient's\noutpatient cardiologist Dr. Baldrige\nAccording to the prior cardiac cath reports , the patient should\nbe on lifelong Plavix. It is Dr. Stayrook 's preference for\nthe patient to be started on thromboembolic prophylatic Coumadin\n( in the setting of paroxysmals of atrial fibrillation ) and to\ndiscontinue the aspirin because of possible bleeding risk on\ncombination aspirin , Plavix and Coumadin. However , he is\ndeferring this decision to be made by the patient's outpatient\ncardiologist.\nBlood Pressure: The cardiologist consultation Dr.\nMiehe felt that the chest pain and hypertension symptoms could\nbe consistent with recurrence of renal artery stenosis. On\n10/27/07 , a Doppler renal ultrasound was notable for significant\nre-stenosis of the left renal artery. The patient an\nangioplasty and stent was placed without peri-procedure\ncomplication aside from the possibility of small blood loss ( as\nwill be described in heme section below ).\n2. Hematology: The patient has baseline hypoproliferative\nnormocytic normochromic anemia of chronic disease identified by\niron studies. Her B12 and folate levels were within normal\nlimits. On 11/8 , the patient had a hematocrit drop from\n30-26 , but this was considered to be either a lab variant or due\nto blood loss in her subcutaneous tissue from previous Lovenox\ninjections. Lovenox was discontinued and the team decided to use\nTEDs alone for DVT prophylaxis as the patient was ambulatory. On\n10/28 , one day post-angio intervention , the patient was complaining of\nlethargy. She had a post-procedure crit drop from 30-25 which the\nrepeat study was stable at 25. Her hemodynamics\nwas also stable as was her leg exam. The Angiography Team\nadvised that the hematocrit drop could be as result of blood loss\nfrom recent angio intervention. The Angio Team advised that\nthere will be no need to pursue imaging to search for source\nof blood loss unless the patient has further hematocrit drop or unless she\ndevelops leg , abdominal and back pain symptoms. Because of the\npatient's history of coronary disease , she was ordered for a 2units\na blood. She only received one unit of blood because\nshe was symptomatic with hypertension and chest pain when the\nsecond bag was hung ( see cardiovascular pump section above ).\nPost-transfusion hematocrit was 30.1 and was felt no further\nblood would be needed.\n3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. During\nthis admission , her oral agents were held and the team implemented the\nGatea Insulin Diabetic Protocol using NPH basal\ninsulin and pre-prandial aspart scales. The hemoglobin A1c was\n6.8.\n4. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition/renal: The patient had\nessentially stable renal function during this admission. A\nchange in the patient's creatinine from 7/28/28 was\nattributed to medication-induced ( likely from recent lisinopril\ndose increased from last GCGH admit , and/or dehydration ). Lasix was\nand ACE inhibitor were both held. Lasix and ACE were both\nrestarted on 3/1 ( see cardiovascular section above ).\n5. Gastrointestinal: During this admission the patient had\nreported crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea. The medical team\nsuspects possible cause could be ischemia in the setting of\nhypertension , as the patient has significant celiac disease that\nwas identified on an MRA obtained at Palmtial in 10/13 All\nstool studies were negative and as on 9/6 her diarrhea\nresolved.\n6. MISC: After a lengthy discussion with the patient , she opted to be a\nDNI otherwise wanted all other resuscitative measures.",
        "IMPRESSION-14": "IMPRESSION  This is an 82-year-old female who presents with\ncomplaints of intermittent lightheadedness and sudden onset of\nsevere chest and abdominal pressure in the setting of\nhypertensive urgency with documented blood pressure of 194/74.\nHer symptoms resolved with blood pressure control. The medical\nteam suspects that:\n1. The cause of the patient's episodic lightheadedness prompting\nmultiple visits to the D.sen Health may be from atrial\nfibrillation with RVR and/or ventricular pauses. Additional\nworkup for this can be pursued by Dr. Gehrer as an outpatient.\n2. Given the significant history of vascular disease and the\nfindings on recent MRA , the team suspects that the patient may\nhave hypertension-induced gut ischemia and microvascular cardiac\nangina.\nThis is preliminary discharge summary and the discharge addendum\nincluding discharge medications , final diagnoses and medical\nfollowup will need to be dictated at the time of discharge.\neScription document: 1-5694568 CSSten Tel\nDictated By: EMMERLING , QUINTON\nAttending: THON , KERRY\nDictation ID 5456663",

        "OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES-11": "OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES \nThe patient had a debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06. She\nalso had hemodialysis initiated on 10/9/06.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS \n1. Infectious disease: The patient's left foot was encasted by\northopedics surgery on 2/29/06 with evidence of underlying\ninfection. Her wound cultures grew MRSA with probes to the bone.\nX-rays were unrevealing and MRI showed severe osteomyelitis. In\naddition , the patient had an ESR of 109. The patient was thus\nput on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl. Blood cultures from\n6/16/06 additionally grew gram-positive cocci in clusters which\neventually yielded MRSA. However , surveillance cultures with\ntreatment on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl were negative.\nThe patient received debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06.\nIn the OR , the bone looked necrotic and infected. The bone was\nsent to pathology and microbiology , the results of which are\npending. Given the appearance of her bone during debridement , it\nis presumed that the patient will need eight weeks of vancomycin.\nBecause she did have a clear source of fevers after it was found\nthat she had osteomyelitis , the patient was discontinued off\nFlagyl and levofloxacin on 5/6/06.\n2. GI: The patient has abdominal pain with gastric emptying\nstudy on 6/16/06 showing 0% clearance at 90 minutes consistent\nwith severe gastroparesis versus obstruction. Radiology did not\nfeel that an upper GI series would give further information\nregarding obstruction and it was judged to be unlikely given that\nthe patient has bowel movements and rare emesis. Later on in the\nhospital course , the patient was put on erythromycin with a\ndecrease in her symptoms of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting.\nThe patient did have any evidence of bowel ischemia on MRA.\nLater , erythromycin was changed to Reglan on 4/8/06 per renal\nrequest during hemodialysis. There is no evidence of pancreatis\nor liver disease and the patient was also kept on Compazine for\nnausea.\n3. Renal: The patient had , on admission , acute on chronic renal\nfailure. There was a concern for prerenal azotemia in the\nsetting of nausea and vomiting and diarrhea. She had a\nfractional excretion of sodium which was 0.3% , but it was\ndifficult to interpret in the setting of end-stage renal disease.\nLasix and Cozaar were held. However , the creatinine continued\nto worsen reaching 6.1 on 9/14/06. Renal was consulted\nregarding the need for dialysis. On admission , the patient did\nhave matured AV fistula graft and she was thus started on\nhemodialysis on 10/9/06.\n4. Hematology: The patient had an INR which was elevated.\nHematocrit was also decreased to 25.5 from 34. She was guaiac\nnegative and did have any schistocyte. Her LDH was also normal\nwith her haptoglobin high. It was judged from her iron studies\nthat the patient was iron deficient. She was put on iron\nsupplementation. She also was felt to have renal component to\nher anemia and she was started on darbepoetin initially and\nchanged to erythropoietin later during dialysis by renal.\n5. Cardiovascular: The patient was maintained on aspirin , a\nstatin , and calcium channel blocker. She started prophylactic\nbeta-blocker during her hospital course as well.\n6. Endocrine: The patient had hemoglobin A1c of 7.8. She was\ntransitioned to NPH and Aspart during her hospital stay. She had\nintermittent problems with hypoglycemia in the setting of being\nNPO pending operations and procedures; however , her insulin\nregimen was titrated to good glycemic response.\n7. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on heparin and Nexium.\n8. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: Her IV fluids were\nstopped as the patient was oliguric and anuric initially before\nhemodialysis. Later on , she was also put on 1500 mL fluid\nrestriction. Later on during dialysis , her volume status\nresolved euvolemia. She was kept on a low fat and low\ncholesterol diabetic diet.

From the\n1/27/2004 through 10/4/2004 she was readmitted and presented\nwith increased lipase , right upper quadrant pain , shortness of\nbreath , nausea , and decreased oral intake. She was dialyzed and\nthe lipase was felt to be elevated from poor renal clearance. An\nMRI was obtained at that time , which revealed no acute\nabnormalities. Transesophageal echocardiogram was also obtained\nat that time because of the prior positive blood culture and it\nwas negative for vegetation or severe valve disease. A chest CT\nduring this previous admission showed a resolved right pleural\neffusion and some improved interstitial pulmonary edema.\nOn the day prior to admission , she woke up sick and tired at\nrehab. She developed a nonproductive cough and some mild\npleuritic chest pain. In addition , she experienced some right\nupper and right lower quadrant pain , which she had also had\nduring her most recent hospitalization. At Mamcount Un Health , her heart rate was 94 , blood pressure 183/81 , and\nshe was 94% on 2 liters of nasal cannula. She was febrile to\n102.5 and was experiencing chills. She was brought into the\nemergency department where she was found to have blood pressure\nof 134/67. She received 2 mg of morphine approximately a liter\nof normal saline and some Tylenol. A CT scan of her abdomen\nrevealed a fibroid uterus and left kidney cystic lesion.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-5": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION \nHer admission physical examination was significant for\ntemperature of 100.2 , blood pressure of 102/53 , and saturating\n98% on 2 liters. The patient was mildly anxious. She was\nnormocephalic and atraumatic and had surgical pupils bilaterally.\nHer neck was supple and her jugular venous pressure was 8 cm.\nShe had decreased breath sounds throughout and had fine scattered\nrales throughout her lung fields. Heart was regular rate and\nrhythm with normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur\nat the right upper sternal border without any radiation. Her\nabdomen was obese , soft , nontender , and nondistended with good\nbowel sounds. Her extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis , or\nedema. She did have a right arm fistula for hemodialysis with a\ngood thrill. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented x3\nand had a steady gait with a walker.",
        "LABORATORY DATA-6": "LABORATORY DATA \nHer admission laboratory data was significant for a uremia\nrelated to her end-stage renal disease , normal LFTs , cardiac\nenzymes less than assay , and a white count of 17.2 up from 9.2\njust two days earlier. Her hematocrit is at baseline of 30.1.\nHer UA revealed 2 to 4 white cells , 1+ bacteria , and 8 to 10\nhyaline casts. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with no\neffusions and some mildly prominent pulmonary vasculature. EKG\nrevealed normal sinus rhythm and T-wave inversions at 5 and 6 as\nwell as 1 and AVR , which are old.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. Renal: Ms. Hodnefield was maintained on hemodialysis Tuesday ,\nThursday , and Saturdays while in hospital and was followed by the\nrenal service daily. She was maintained on PhosLo calcium\ncarbonate and Nephrocaps for optimum mineral balance while on\ndialysis. Her right arm fistula had a good thrill throughout.\nOn her very first day of admission , she became hypertensive\nduring dialysis , but had a normal blood pressure again after\nreceiving back the ultrafiltration fluid that had been taken off.\nAlso of note during her hospital stay , given her fevers and\nunrevealing infectious workup , an MRI was completed with a renal\nprotocol to evaluate this left renal cyst. The cyst was\ncomplicated and appeared to have septations. However , it did not\nenhance and upon review with the radiologist it was deemed very\nunlikely that this cyst would represent a renal cell carcinoma.\nHowever , her UA did have 1 to 2+ positive blood on repeat in the\nhospital without a Foley. At the time of discharge her urine\ncytology was pending at the time of discharge.\n2. Infectious disease: Given the fact that Ms. Obarr presented\nwith intermittent fevers all the way up to 102 , some mild\nhypertension associated with dialysis , and previous positive\nblood cultures , an infectious disease consult was called. After\nextensive infectious disease workup including blood cultures ,\nurine cultures , abdomen CTs , as well as induced sputum , no source\nfor infection was revealed. However , it was felt that Ms. Molacek\nmay have had a viral upper respiratory tract infection and/or\nbronchitis which was not treated. She received a single dose of\nvancomycin and gentamicin upon admission for her hypertension and\nfever , but received no further antibiotics during her hospital\nstay. She was afebrile during the last seven days and had a\nstable white count and no left shift. Workup\nfor infectious disease included an HIV test , which was negative.\nShe was PPD negative. Her induced sputum was negative for\nfungus , mycoplasma , and PCP. Her abdominal CT revealed no\nobvious abscess and urine analysis was negative. Blood cultures\nx2 as well as cultures from previous admissions were held for\nfungal and hacek organisms , all of which were negative.\n3. Pulmonary: Ms. Altizer 's only stable complaint from her\nprevious hospital stays has been mild dyspnea. She experienced\ndyspnea on exertion after walking 10 to 15 feet. A chest CT from\nher last admission revealed no interstitial lung disease , no\nsignificant pulmonary edema , and no infiltrative disease. She\nhad a set of PSP on 3/11/2003 , which revealed a restrictive\nphysiology , but may not have had sufficient effort. The\npulmonary consult was called. Of note , the patient had an\nechocardiogram from 9/1 , which revealed a pulmonary artery\nsystolic pressure of 59. It was felt that this may have been\nspurious as the previous echocardiogram revealed aortic pressure\nin the 30s. She received a repeat an transthoracic\nechocardiogram which showed a pulmonary artery systolic pressure\nof 36% in right atrium. This is her baseline pressure. The\nprevious pressure was probably artificially elevated because of\nvolume overload. This means that it is unlikely that pulmonary\nhypertension is causing her shortness of breath. Overnight pulse\noximetry revealed no desaturations and there is a very low\nprobability of sleep apnea despite habitus and a low probability\nbased on her history. She does not report any daytime\nsomnolence. It is possible that outpatient pulmonary function\ntest and sleep studies will be considered if this dyspnea\ncontinues. There was no need for a right heart catheterization\nnor was there any need to pursue further imaging to think about\nchronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. By the time she\nwas discharged and working with PT regularly , Ms. Lohmann 's\ndyspnea was significantly improved. It is still unclear why she\nwas no dyspneic and may be a combination of deconditioning ,\nrepeated hospitalizations , and will be improved with\nrehabilitation.\n4. Cardiovascular: Ms. Pullian is exhibiting no signs or\nischemia. Her EKG showed chronic lateral T-wave inversions. Her\ncardiac enzymes were negative. She was maintained on the baby\naspirin as well as beta-blocker throughout her hospital stay.\nMs. Reenders did have a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed\nan estimated ejection fraction of 45 to 50% , some mid septal and\nlateral hypokinesis which was old , some mildly thickened aortic\nvalve with no aortic insufficiency , mildly thickened mitral valve\nwith mild mitral regurgitation. Her tricuspid valve revealed\nthere as mild TR and a tricuspid jet of 3 meters per second ,\nwhich was translated into a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of\n36 mmHg right atrial pressure. Also , of note she had biatrial\nenlargement and normal right ventricle size and function. After\nthe initial episode of hypertension and hemodialysis , Ms. Plotts\nwas normotensive throughout the remainder of her hospital stay\nand was discharged on a beta-blocker as well as ACE inhibitor.\n5. FEN/GI: Ms. Gottschalk 's abdominal pain resolved on day two of\nhospitalization and given a negative CT , normal movements , and no\nfurther abdominal pain , nausea , or vomiting , it was felt that\nthis may have been related to either due to either viral\ngastroenteritis or irritable bowel syndrome. The patient was\nmaintained on proton pump inhibition and while inhouse had a low\nsodium diabetic diet with 1800 calories as well as low potassium\nfor her renal care.\n6. Disposition: Physical therapy consulted early in Ms.\nCrull hospital stay and agreed that she would benefit from\nsubacute rehabilitation to get her strength back after these\nmultiple hospitalizations. She was given a walker and could walk\nwith assistance on a rolling walker. Unfortunately , her home has\nstairs and is ill equipped for such a transition from walker to\nhome so she will benefit from rehabilitation. Ms. Shirai was\ndischarged in stable condition and will follow up with her\nprimary care doctor Dr. Mighty at GUAM MEDICAL CENTER Clinic.",

She was treated with\noral hypoglycemics initially. In 1985 she was hospitalized for a\nquestionable episode of diabetic ketoacidosis with recurrent\npolydipsia , polyuria , nausea and vomiting and she was changed to\ninsulin treatment.\nSubsequently , the patient had intermittent compliance , with\noccasional dietary indiscretions with greater than 2500 calories\nintake and decreased exercise. Her dose of insulin in 1991 was\nHumulin N 40 units subcutaneous qam and 20 units qpm with regular\ninsulin 5 units qam and 5 units qpm added. In April of 1993 her\nglycosylated hemoglobin ( hemoglobin A1C ) was 20.2 and her finger\nstick blood glucose was 265. On August , 1993 her finger stick\nblood glucose ranged from 96 to 189. In October 1994 her insulin\ndosing was 40 units subcutaneous qam and regular 5 units qam , 5\nunits of regular q noon and 5 units qpm.\nIn early October of 1994 her finger stick blood glucoses ranged\nbetween 160 and 240. She indicated she was depressed about her\ndiabetes. On January she awoke at 5 am and had 10 episodes of\nemesis progressing from clear to greenish to black.

ALLERGIES:\nTo Penicillin and sulfa drugs , the results of which were not clear.\nAlso , aspirin caused epistaxis in the past. FAMILY AND SOCIAL",
        "HISTORY-4": "HISTORY  She lives by herself. She works as a lawyer and professor\nof law. She noted that her family history is positive for adult\nonset diabetes mellitus in her mother and her grandmother as well\nas a family history of hypertension. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Revealed\nmetromenorrhagia and increased menstrual flow recently. She also\nnoted she had decreased her exercise recently.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-5": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  On physical examination her vital signs were\nas follows: Temperature 99.7 , heart rate of\n127 , blood pressure and respiratory rate normal. She was a\npleasant , young , black female frequently vomiting. HEENT: Notable\nfor normal examination. Neck supple. There was brisk carotid\nupstrokes , no thyromegaly was noted. Lungs were clear to\nauscultation and percussion. Heart was tachycardic. S1 and S2\nwith a holosystolic murmur heard at the apex radiating to the left\nsternal border. There was an early decrescendo diastolic murmur at\nthe base in the aortic area , the lateral resolved with fluids.\nAbdomen was tender in the epigastrium , it was very tender in the\nsuprapubic area. Extremities were without edema , cord cyanosis or\nerythema. Neurological examination was within normal limits on\nmodalities.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "HOSPITAL COURSE  Ms. Buffey was admitted with a diagnosis of\ndiabetic ketoacidosis. She was started on\nintravenous fluids of D5 normal saline with 40 mEq of potassium per\nliter. She also received and insulin drip intravenously. She had\nher finger stick blood glucoses checked every 2 hours. She also\nhad her blood electrolytes and acid tests checked frequently.\nGiven the fact that she was febrile and had presented with\nacidosis , had a harsh cardiac murmur , she had blood cultures times\n3 drawn. There were no obvious sources of infection.\nRegarding her GI bleed , she began to cough up coffee ground emesis\nafter repeated episodes of wretching throughout the day. The\nbleeding was thought to be due to a Mallory-Weiss tear due to the\nexcessive vomiting. The patient had an NG tube placed for lavage\nwhich quickly lavaged clear after approximately 1 liter of diluant.\nA nasal gastric tube was put to Gomco low suction. Additionally ,\nthe patient had intravenous fluids running and her orthostatics and\nhematocrit were checked frequently. She was started on H2 blockers\nintravenously and a GI consultation was obtained.\nRegarding the diabetic ketoacidosis , the patient obtained\nconsultation from the Endocrine Division. With intravenous fluids\nand insulin drip her ketoacidosis resolved. The endocrinologist\nsuggested the ultimate regimen of insulin which will be described\nbelow. Notably , the patient indicated that she could not reliably\ntime the midday lunch schedule. Therefore , the patient was given\nsome flexibility in terms of dosing of insulin at that hour.\nRegarding her cardiac workup , the patient was noted to have a loud\nsystolic murmur. She was evaluated by the Dell Hospital\nwho recommended echocardiography. The results of the\nechocardiogram were as described below. The echocardiogram was\nobtained on 2 of July , the results were as follows: The left atrium\nwas mildly dilated. The tricuspid valve leaflet excursion was\nmildly increased with tricuspid regurgitation measured as 2+ out of\n4+ with a peak velocity of 2.5. It was thought that she had a\nmildly dilated right atrium and a mildly concentric hypertrophied\nleft ventricle. Mitral regurgitation was 3+ out of 4+. Left\nventricular wall thickness was upper limits of normal with\npreserved left ventricular systolic function ejection fraction of\n65 percent. The patient abnormalities of her atrial ventricular\ncanal noted consistent with ostium primum. Her left and right\natrial ventricular grooves inserted at the same level of the\nintraventricular septum. There was some evidence of flow reversal\nin the pulmonary veins as well as the mitral regurgitation noted\nabove. There was a high flow velocity jet seen in the paramembrane\nof intraventricular septum , moving from left to right , consistent\nwith residual ventricular septal defect. There was no atrial\nseptal defect seen status post surgical repair. There was a small\nechocardiogram bright density at the left ventricular site of the\nparamembranous septum thought to be an anomalous cord attachment\nfrom the mitral valve versus endocarditis.\nOn January , the patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram\nto evaluate this abnormality seen above. There was no evidence of\nresidual atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect. There\nwas an anomalous chordal attachment to the base of the interior\nleaflet of the mitral valve and no endocarditis vegetations were\nseen.\nThe patient was noted to have hypertension and was started on\nLisinopril , nifedipine was transiently given but was discontinued.\nThe patient was discharged in satisfactory condition on October ,\n1994. There were no complications of the hospitalization.\nOperations and procedures of the hospitalization were an esophageal\ngastroduodenoscopy by Dr. Cornea on July , 1994.",

The source of\nhistory was the patient , who was a moderate historian and the old\nchart. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: According to the patient , she\nfirst presented to the medical system in 1989. At that time she\nwas walking at home and became dizzy. She was taken to Meeville Valley Health in Rhode Island She was told that she had a heart\nattack and was placed on a monitor when she was noted to have an\nepisode of asystole on the monitor. This led to emergent pacer\ninsertion. After pacer placement , the dizziness never recurred\nuntil a few months ago. This led to hospitalization on May , 1994\nat Xas*tu Hospital Medical Center .  She was seen by the pacer service\nwho interrogated her pacer and found it functioning normally.\nHowever , the pacer lead type ( MECHRONIC 4012 ) is felt to have a\nhigh failure rate , necessitating a new pacer insertion.\nUnfortunately , the patient left AMA before the procedure could be\nperformed.\nToday , the patient got out of bed and preceded to the bathroom ,\nwhere she had a normal bowel movement without any symptoms. She\ngot up from the toilet and while walking back to bed became dizzy\nagain. She subsequently passed out for an undetermined time.\nAfter waking up she knew exactly where she was and had no\npost-ictal symptoms. She fell to the floor , but denies any trauma.\nShe also denied urinary/fecal incontinence during this episode.\nShe adamantly denies chest pain , shortness of breath or significant\npalpitations.

Considering her history , it was felt that she certainly\nhad a symptomatic bradycardic episode. Because her current\npacemaker had a very high failure rate , we recommended changing the\npacemaker and the patient agreed. She was placed on the cardiac\nmonitor without any event over her hospital stay.\nAs part of her prepacer work-up , she had a right upper extremity\nvenogram which showed patent vessels on that side. The patient had\na pacemaker insertedon 24 of November in the OR without any complications.\nThe reason it was done in the OR was because of her large size and\nthe strength of the table.

The patient's\ncoronary risk factors include age , male gender , positive family\nhistory , history of myocardial infarction , diabetes mellitus , and\nhypercholesterolemia. The patient has no history of hypertension\nor tobacco use. The patient's history actually began in 1988 when\nhe had chest pain and ruled in for an anteroseptal myocardial\ninfarction. In 9/16 , he presented to the emergency room with wide\ncomplex tachycardia requiring electrical cardioversion at the\nJoadi Community Hospital .  During the admission in 1998 , the\npatient had a catheterization which revealed proximal LAD\nocclusion , an occluded proximal descending artery off his right\ncoronary artery , normal hemodynamics , anteroseptal hypokinesis ,\ninferior hypokinesis , apical thrombus , and aneurysm with an EF of\n50%. An EP study revealed 27 and 22 beat runs of nonsustained\nV-tach with left bundle branch block inducible after three\nventricular extra stimuli during ventricular drive pacing at 400\nmsec. The ventricular tachycardia was initially suppressed with\nquinidine , but the patient subsequently developed nausea and\nvomiting , and the quinidine was switched to aconine. The\npatient did well on this regimen until 3/13 , when he developed\ndyspnea on exertion , no chest pain , PND , and orthopnea. In 1/16 ,\nthe patient had an exercise tolerance test , which she failed\nsecondary to fatigue. During this ETT , his blood pressure actually\nfell from 125 to 85 systolic and his EKG revealed 1 mm ST\ndepression in the limb leads. Therefore , on 8/5/93 , he was\nadmitted to the Eredrens Recraw University Of Medical Center and underwent cardiac\ncatheterization , which revealed 100% LAD and RCA occlusion , 60%\nproximal ramus stenosis , and left ventriculogram revealed anterior\nhypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , and apical dyskinesis with an\nejection fraction of 48%. The decision was then made during his\n1/16 admission to proceed with surgical revascularization. During\nhis admission , he underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass\ngraft with LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the right\ncoronary artery and proximal descending artery , with endarterectomy\nto the proximal descending artery. The patient also underwent an\nEP study , and it was found that his sustained ventricular was no\nlonger inducible either at baseline or during isoproterenol\ninfusion. Since 1993 , the patient has been doing well up until the\nday of admission on 3/1 .\nOn the day of admission , the patient developed light-headedness and\npalpitations while using the toilet. The patient denied any chest\npain , dyspnea , nausea or vomiting at the time. EMS was notified ,\nand the patient was found to be in V-tach. The patient was taken\nto an outside hospital and cardioverted at 100 joules after failing\nattempted pharmacologic conversion with Lidocaine , adenosine , and\namiodarone. The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and was\ntransferred to the Villecam Medical Center for further evaluation\nand possible placement of AICD.\nOn his admission , the patient was without complaints except for\nsome mild lower abdominal pain , which the patient attributed to his\nknown constipation.",

The patient had a four-beat run of VT.\nOn postop day #13 , he was supposed to have PEG placed today.\nMetabolic support said that someone called the OR desk yesterday\nand canceled the procedure , so it was rescheduled for Tuesday due\nto no OR availability. Otherwise , the patient was supposed to\nhave repeat video swallow next week. Hemodynamically stable.\nHolding Coumadin. Rehabilitation when ready.\nOn postop day #14 , PEG tube placement rescheduled for next\nTuesday , giving low-dose Coumadin for A fib , at goal tube feeds\nthrough Dobhoff , hemodynamically stable.\nOn postop day #15 , doing well. General surgery consult called to\ntry and get PEG placed earlier the next Tuesday. Dr. Len Dechart will do it either tomorrow or Monday at the latest.\nOtherwise , doing well , n.p.o. after midnight. Hopefully , he will\nget PEG and can go to rehabilitation.\nOn postop day #16 , tube feeding restarted. PEG placement\ntomorrow. Otherwise , doing well , rate controlled A fib.\nRehabilitation once PEG tube placed.\nOn postop day #17 , finally received peg today , currently on D5 in\na half at 50 mL an hour , okay to give meds through PEG and can\nrestart tube feeds tomorrow.

She has known obesity\nhypoventilation syndrome. She was weaned from assist control to\npressure support ventilation. On the 25 of May , the patient self\nextubated , was put on bipap and then quickly transitioned to\nnasal cannula. The patient did report needing bipap at night at\none point though later on it was felt that she was not on bipap\nat night normally. She has an elevated right hemidiaphragm seen\non chest x-ray and at baseline sats 90-93% on 2 liters. On the\nfloor , she was seen by pulmonary consult about management of her\nobesity ventilation syndrome. At the time of discharge the\npatient is to sleep on bipap 10/0. Those parameters will need to\nbe optimized with a sleep study after discharge and , in addition ,\nthe patient will have to be observed at night with sats being\nmonitored to qualify her for bipap at night. In the hospital we\ndid monitor her sats overnight and she satted 85-87% on 2 liters\nof nasal cannula when she was sleeping at night.\n2. Infectious Disease: The patient had a right lower lobe\npneumonia treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl that was started\nin the Emergency Department on November , 2005. She will\ncomplete a 14 day course of those antibiotics. The patient was\nconsistently afebrile and the thought was the patient had\naspiration right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient did receive a\nfew doses of Vancomycin which was later discontinued. The\npatient was also treated by Diflucan and Flagyl to cover BV/yeast\ninfection as the patient was noted to have some vaginal\ndischarge. The vaginal discharge ultimately had negative\ncultures. The patient also had a known stage IV decubitus in her\nsacral area that did not appear to be infected.\n3. Cardiovascular: The patient was volume overloaded after\nreceiving significant fluids when she first presented. She had a\nleft pleural effusion on subsequent chest x-rays. She was\ndiuresed aggressively with Lasix. Typical doses were 40 mg IV\nand at the time of discharge the patient could comfortably lie\nflat on her back without any discomfort. The patient also was\nnoted to have some ectopy. Her lytes were repleted. An\nechocardiogram was checked which showed normal EF moderate right\nventricular dysfunction and no wall motion abnormalities. This\ndid not demonstrate any change from prior.\n4. Neuropsych: The patient had an altered mental status likely\nrelated to hypercarbic respiratory failure and also hypoxemia at\nthe time of present admission. She was weaned off sedation. She\nhad a negative head CT. When she was extubated , the patient was\nalert and oriented and returned back to baseline mental status.\n5. Heme: The patient was immobile at baseline and is high risk\nfor PET protocol. CT at the time of admission was negative and\nthe patient was treated with Lovenox prophylaxis. The patient\nwas also continued on her iron pills.\n6. Renal: The patient has metabolic compensation for\nrespiratory acidosis which resolved during the ICU stay , and the\npatient's creatinine return to baseline during her\nhospitalization.\n7. GI: The patient received tube feeds through her OG tube and\nwas transitioned to p.o.'s.\n8. Surgery/GYN: The patient has a known colonic vaginal fistula\nwith purulent vaginal discharge.

On 10/9/05 , he had fevers to 101.5 and\ncongestion throughout the day despite getting nebs and oxygen ,\nhis condition did not improve , he vomited twice and was noted to\nbe hypoxic to an oxygen saturation of 84% on 5 liters of O2 , he\nalso had a temperature of 101.6 , a heart rate of 127 , a blood\npressure of 140/80 and was sent to the En Medical Center Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department , the\npatient's vital signs showed a temperature of 102.6 , heart rate\nof 133 , respiratory rate of 24 , blood pressure 155/72 and 93%\noxygen saturation on nasal cannula. His EKG initially showed ST\nelevations inferiorly. He was evaluated by Cardiology who felt\nthat given his comorbidities and poor functional status he was\nnot a candidate for cardiac catheterization. His EKGs\nspontaneously normalized without intervention. His first set of\ncardiac enzymes was negative. His chest x-ray showed a\nleft-sided pneumonia and he had a white blood cell count of 34.\nHe received 2 liters of normal saline , cefotaxime , and Flagyl.\nHe also received Lopressor and aspirin.

He was readmitted on 2/6/05 to 10/21/05\nfor a change in mental status during which he was given\nantibiotics on and off for the VP shunt. He resolved during this\nhospitalization to baseline and was discharged to the nursing\nhome.

Pneumonia: The patient was thought to have a likely\naspiration pneumonia despite his PEG tube because of reported\nvomiting at the nursing home. He was put on broad antibiotic\ncoverage of vancomycin , ceftazidime , and Flagyl. He was\ncontinued on a 14-day course of antibiotics with clinical\nimprovement. His antibiotics were discontinued after 14 days and\nhe remained afebrile with the normal white count. Of note , on\n2/16/05 , he had another episode of vomiting , which was thought\nto result in another aspiration event. However , repeat chest\nx-rays showed no additional pneumonia and given that he was\ntreated with a full two-week course of antibiotics it was decided\nto end his course of antibiotics and he remained afebrile with a\nnormal white blood cell count.\n2. Cardiovascular: The patient initially had ST elevations\nnormalized. This was thought likely to be due to demand ischemia\ngiven its complete resolution. Per Cardiology recommendations ,\nhe was not a candidate for long-term anticoagulation or cardiac\ncatheterization. He was continued on medical management without\nfurther incident.\n3. Hypertension: The patient was persistently hypertensive and\nhis blood pressure medications were titrated up and additional\nmedications were added as described in discharge medication list.\n4. Diabetes: The patient's insulin regimen was titrated up to\ncover persistently high morning blood sugars given tube feeds\novernight.\n5. Neurological: The patient had a baseline aphasia and was\ndifficult to communicate with , however , as his pneumonia\nresolved , his mental status improved and he was able to\ncommunicate with short phrases and answer yes or no questions.\n6. FEN: He was receiving tube feeds overnight per Nutrition\nrecommendations. He was also receiving NPH and regular insulin\nas described in discharge medications.\n7. C. difficile: The patient had some diarrhea and was tested\nfor C. diff. This returned positive and he was continued on\nFlagyl for a total of 3-4-week course as determined by the rehab\nfacility.",

There was\nan ethics consult meeting on 4/4/05 to determine the goals of\ncare. Per discussion at that meeting which is documented in the\nmedical chart , It was decided that he remain full code. This\nwill need to be readdressed with Mr. Feltmann at some point when it\ncan be determined if he is competent for making this decision.\nPlease see the chart for further details on the results of this\nethics consult.

CT chest shows anterior fifth rib fractures\nbilaterally. There was also some supraclavicular stranding along\nthe left side , without any evidence of vessel injury. CT of the\nabdomen and pelvis is negative , except for a ruptured renal cyst.\nHe was also incidentally noted to show diverticulosis , without\nany diverticulitis. The CT of the thoracic and lumbar spines\nalso demonstrated no fractures , although there were incidentally\nnoted to be anterior osteophytes in numerous levels. CT of the\nchest demonstrated the rib fractures , but was otherwise negative.\nLaboratory , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate\n25 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 185 , and anion gap is 10 , AST\nand ALT are 20 and 25 respectively.

Urinalysis was negative.\nReview of the prehospital EKG demonstrated a complete\n( third-degree ) heart block. However , EKG done immediately upon\nadmission to the Trauma Bay demonstrated a bifascicular block ,\nwith a rate in the 40s.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS-14": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS \n1. Cardiovascular: He was admitted to the Cardiac Step-Down\nUnit. He had Zoll pacer pads were placed upon his chest , and\natropine remained at his bedside. He also had an additional Zoll\npacer pads , as well as the pacemaker standby at the bedside ,\nhowever , these were not needed , as he has completed asymptomatic\nwith his bifascicular block. He had serial enzymes , which were\nperformed , he was ruled out for myocardial infarction. He went\nto the Cardiac Cath Lab , which demonstrated some coronary artery\ndisease. Please see the dictated cardiology reports for the\nfindings of the Cath Lab. It was felt , however , this was\nunchanged from prior studies. He also went to the\nElectrophysiology Lab. They were unable to induce any\nventricular tachycardia or other dysrhythmias during the\nprolonged EP studies. He had a pacemaker inserted. The\npacemaker was followed by the Electrophysiology Service , and was\nfound to be working adequately. The attending was Dr. Matt Duropan ,\nwith the Electrophysiology Service. Dr. Caires with the\nCardiology Service saw him and was attending on record.\n2. Neurology: He was seen by the Neurology Service. So , this\nwas under Dr. Edgardo Mccorison , the attending neurologist on the\ncase. He had an MRI/MRA performed of his head and neck. The\ndiffusion-weighted images demonstrated no evidence of any\nabnormality. There was a region of increase signal intensity on\nthe T2 and FLAIR images , involving the vasoganglion , extending\nthe corona radiata. Therefore , given the fact that signal was\nseen on the T2 and FLAIR , not on the diffusion-weighted , it was\nfelt that this was at least 10 days old. Therefore , this was not\nfelt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehicle\ncollision. It was most likely represented an old CVA , which was\nnot previously detected. Given the fact that the patient\nremained asymptomatic , and had a normal neurological exam , and\nradiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10\ndays old , and this was not further addressed. An MRA of his head\nand neck demonstrated tortuous vertebrobasilar system. The\nMRI/MRA of the neck was essentially normal , however , the left\nbifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis.\nThe right bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis ,\nhowever , could not be completed excluded. Given artifact , this\ncould be further followed up with an outpatient venous duplex of\nthe carotid arteries.\n3. Musculoskeletal: He was seen by the Orthopedic Service in\nthe Emergency Department at the time of the trauma , he ultimately\nhad an MRI that was performed of his knee. This showed tears of\nthe medial and lateral menisci. There was no evidence of\nfracture. He remained in a knee immobilizer. He saw Physical\nTherapy , which felt that further therapy would be indicated.\nWith the impression of the Orthopedic Service that no acute\nintervention was needed , and that he should follow-up with Sports\nMedicine or Orthopedics in approximately 3-4 weeks. In addition ,\nhe was noted to have several rib fractures. The rib fractures\nwere felt to be the source of his pain , he continue to complain\nof some inspiratory pain throughout his chest. However , he\nadamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall upon\ninspiring. It was therefore felt that given the negative enzymes\nand the negative Cath , and the known rib fractures that the chest\npain was strictly a result of a musculoskeletal pain. This pain\nwas well controlled with the combination of Dilaudid and\noxycodone. He was encouraged to take several deep breaths per\nhour to reduce the risk of atelectasis or pneumonia.\n4. Infectious Disease: There was no evidence of any acute\ninfection. Of note , his white count was trending upwards , on the\nlast two days of admission. It was felt that this probably\nrepresented stress , given all the recent procedures that were\ndone , including the catheterization and the electrophysiology\nstudies , rather than A2 infection. The chest x-ray was performed\non the 25th , which demonstrated no infiltrate. This was reviewed\nwith an attending radiologist who reported low lung volumes.\nOtherwise , it was essentially negative. In addition , a repeat\nurinalysis was performed. The results are pending at the time of\ndictation , however , will be followed up prior to the patient's\ndischarge from the hospital. The patient appears well , and\nstates that he is feeling at his best since the accident.\nHowever , further workup for his white count is not performed at\nthe present time , however , the patient is informed , as the No Hospital and the discharge summary , which show that the patient\nseem to develop any evidence of infection that he should be\nreevaluated by a physician.\n5. Nutrition: The patient is able to eat without any\ndifficulty. He was eating regular house diabetic/cardiac diet.\n6. Hypercholesterolemia: He was continued on his Zocor\nthroughout the hospitalization.\n7. Prophylaxis: He was initially treated with Lovenox 40 mg\nsub-Q. q. day for a prophylaxis against DVTs. He is also on\naspirin and Plavix for secondary cardiac and neurological\nprophylaxis. The Lovenox is discontinued , at the request of the\nElectrophysiology Service on the 24th.\n8. Endocrine: Given the numerous contrast studies , initially\nhis metformin was held. However , he was later restarted on this.\nIn addition , he was continued on his glyburide and covered with\nsliding scale insulin. His blood sugar was never any significant\nproblem during his hospitalization.\n9. Disposition: The patient will be going to Missp Medical Center , in\nstable condition. At the Rehab , he will continue to get physical\ntherapy , which he has received in the hospital. It was felt that\na short course of rehab would benefit the patient to allow him to\ngo back living independently again. He will be discharged to the\nRehab in stable condition.",

        "ADDENDUM-16": "ADDENDUM \nMr. Flentge had this pacemaker placed and was recovering\nuneventfully. However , it was noted that he started having\nincreasing white count. It was felt this was perhaps due to a\nmild urine infection and was started on Levaquin. However , he\nstarted the next day complaining increasing pain in his knee. At\nthis time , his white count had risen to 23 , 000. The knee was\nobviously a concern for possible infection. His knee was warm ,\nwas tender and was erythematous , compared to the contralateral\nside. As a result , the Orthopedic Service was again consulted.\nAn arthrocentesis was performed on his left knee , this was a dry\ntap; no fluid was able to be obtained. The subsequent day , he\nwas complaining of increasing pain , and the sed rate returned in\nthe 99 with a CRP of 190. The EP Service again evaluated the\npatient , and felt that there was no evidence of any clear\ninfection from the pacer site. He continued to have no erythema\nor tenderness around the pacer site. His chest x-ray was\nessentially unremarkable. The next day ( 10/9/05 ) , he was seen\nby the Rheumatology Service , under Dr. Burris who also felt this\nwas most likely to be prepatellar bursitis , probably septic in\nnature , with a hematoma. He was asked to seen by the Infectious\nDisease Service , under Dr. Ferlic and Lou Marzinske\nHe was started on Ancef 1 gm q.8h.

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-3": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Briefly , Ms. Quist is an\n81-year-old female with a known history of severe aortic stenosis\nand multiple medical comorbidities who had been transferred from\nan outside hospital to the Coronary Care Unit for\ncongestive heart failure likely related to overwhelming aortic\ndisease. She had previously declined aortic valve replacement in\nthe year prior to her admission. She had an echo performed at\noutside hospital just prior to admission to Lumca Hospital showed an EF of 55-60% with severe aortic stenosis , an\naortic valve area of 0.6 cm square as well as 1+ mitral regurg\nand 1-2+ tricuspid regurg. She was admitted to the medical\nservice at MH where she was aggressively diuresed. She was also\nprepared for urgent aortic valve replacement and possible\ncoronary artery bypass grafting. At the time of her admission ,\nher past medical history included hypertension , peripheral\nvascular disease , history of stroke with left upper extremity\nsensory loss , diabetes type 2 , hypothyroidism ,\nhypercholesterolemia , renal failure with bilateral renal artery\nstenosis , parkinsonianism , iron-deficiency anemia , vitamin B12\ndeficiency , obstructive sleep apnea , seizure disorder and colon\ncancer status post resection in 1987. She is unable to elaborate\non the details of that resection. She also had renal artery\nstenting in 2005.",

        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-6": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  At the time of admission , her physical\nexam showed a woman 5 feet 1 inches tall , weighing 94 kilos in\nobvious mild respiratory distress. Her temperature was 97 and heart\nrate was 83 and sinus. Her blood pressure in the right arm was\n120/63 , in the left arm was 109/53. She was on 5L of nasal\ncannula while satting 99%. The remainder of her physical exam was\nnotable only for a loud holosystolic murmur at the right upper\nsternal border and radiation to her both carotid arteries. Her\nAllen's test showed severely dampened waveform in both left and\nright radial arteries. Her chest sounded congested with rales\npresent bilaterally and her extremities showed 1-2+ bilateral\nlower extremity edema. Her carotid , radial and femoral arteries\nwere all 2+ , but her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial were\npresent only by Doppler bilaterally.",
        "LABORATORY DATA-7": "LABORATORY DATA  Notable lab data at the time of admission\nincluded a BUN and creatinine of 79 and 3.1 respectively and a\nbeta natriuretic peptide of 39 , 085. Cardiac catheterization performed on\n9/10/06 showed 60% lesion of the ostial LAD as well as an 80% proximal LAD\nlesion. She also had 90% ostial D1 and a 40% ostial OM1 lesion and right\ndominant circulation. Her echo on 5/26/06 showed an ejection fraction of\n60% , severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 60 mmHg and a\npeak gradient of 99 mmHg. Again her calculated valve area is 0.6\ncm square. Her chest x-ray on 5/26/06 was consistent with\ncongestive heart failure and appeared very fluid overloaded. She\nwas taken on 9/10/06 to the operating room where aortic valve\nreplacement with aortic root patch was performed , 21 Biocor\nporcine graft was inserted. She also had a two-vessel coronary\nartery bypass grafting using vein to her left anterior descending\nand vein grafting to her D1 vessel. She tolerated the procedure\nrelatively well , but her ensuing ICU course was protracted and\nvery complicated and will be summarized systematically.\nNeurologically , the patient suffered no acute complications\npostoperatively; however , her state of consciousness waxed and\nwaned with her overall condition.\nFrom a cardiovascular standpoint , the patient suffered a perioperative MI in\nthe late hours of 9/10/06 and on to the early hours of 5/17/06 .  She also\nwent into atrial fibrillation on postoperative day two and\nsuffered rhythm abnormalities for the remainder of her\npostoperative course. Multiple conversion attempts were made\nboth pharmaceutically as well as with electrocardioversion , but\nshe occasionally did covert to normal sinus rhythm. Ultimately ,\nshe reverted back into atrial fibrillation. The third\npostoperative day , she became hypotensive and asystolic. Chest\ncompressions were initiated for less than one minute at which\ntime atrial pacing was initiated and her rhythm was regained with\nadequate blood pressure , though she was returned on to several\ndays of active drips to support her blood pressure. From this\npoint , Ms. Pavick developed dependence on pressors and inotropic\nagents to support her blood pressure and cardiovascular system.\nAfter several months with no real recovery of her cardiovascular\nstatus , the family decided to withdraw care and put her on\ncomfort measures only. She ultimately suffered a cardiac arrest\non 1/16/07 .\nFrom a pulmonary perspective , while she was extubated on the morning of\npostoperative day #2 , she was ultimately reintubated and several pulmonary\ncomplications required multiple bronchoscopies , multiple thoracentesis on both\nchest for recurrent effusions and several chest tubes had to be placed for\naforementioned effusions. She was ultimately trached by the third\nweek and although she did occasionally come off the ventilator at\ntimes , she never displayed adequate pulmonary function to be free\nfrom vent dependence for any length of time.\nFrom a GI perspective , with her trach , she underwent a percutaneous\nendoscopic gastrostomy tube for enteral feeds and at times needed to be\nplaced on total parenteral nutrition as she only occassionally tolerated\ntube feeds. She did develop a Clostridium difficile infection\nand had to be placed on long-term TPN until resolution of that\ninfection.\nHer renal status at baseline was poor , though she was not on dialysis.\nPostoperatively , she never recovered any meaningful renal function of her own.\nShe was placed on continuous venovenous hemodialysis by the third\nweek ultimately became anuric , requiring triweekly hemodialysis on Monday ,\nWednesday and Friday , a schedule she was managed on until the time of her\ndeath.\nFrom an ID standpoint , she developed many bacteremias and GI\ninfections as previously discussed. The Infectious Disease Team\nwas involved in her care and there recommendations were followed\nthroughout her hospitalization. For the greater duration of her\nICU course , she was maintained on vancomycin , levofloxacin and\nFlagyl on and off for multiple infections.\nFrom an endocrine standpoint , she was maintained on her Synthroid dosing and\nwas on a CZI drip for blood sugar control throughout her ICU course.\nHematologically , the patient was transfused many many blood\nproducts over the course of her ICU stay. She also developed\nheparin-induced thrombocytopenia and subsequent clots to her left\nlower extremity requiring vascular surgery intervention. She had\nembolectomy and thrombectomy of her left common femoral artery as\nwell as a left common femoral endarterectomy with patch\nangioplasty on 3/13/06 .  She was maintained on bivalirudin and\nCoumadin throughout her ICU course.\nGiven her preoperative status and multiple medical comorbidities as well as her\noverall poor prognosis through many postsurgical complications , a family\nmeeting on 10/12/07 resulted in decision to withdraw support and provide\ncomfort measures only. At that time , tube feeds were stopped , hemodialysis was\nstopped\nand the patient was made comfortable with morphine until her\nultimate cardiac arrest at 0235 am on 1/16/07 .\neScription document: 6-6942755 CSSten Tel\nDictated By: RAMRIREZ , WILBURN\nAttending: DOBRE , JASPER ELLIOTT\nDictation ID 2244694",

In October 1992 she presented in atrial\nfibrillation which was well controlled on Quinidine. The Quinidine\nwas discontinued the following year in April when the patient had a\nsyncopal episode. At that time , she ruled out for myocardial\ninfarction and failed Sotalol with increasing PR and QT intervals.\nHolter study was negative at that time. Persantine scan showed no\nST changes noted and a fixed defect was present. The patient was\ndischarged on Lopressor. On August , 1993 she was admitted with\nright ankle pain , right lower extremity swelling. Lineis were\nnegative at that time. On 10/5/93 she was admitted in atrial\nflutter with II:I conduction. Trial of procainamide was complicated\nby increasing QT intervals. The Procainimide was therefore\ndiscontinued and the Propafenone was begun. The patient underwent\nsuccessful DC cardioversion and was discharged on Propafenone 225\nt.i.d. and Lasix 80 q day. Since the morning before admission she\nfelt light-headed and sweaty. She began to run out of Propafenone\ntwo days before admission and decreased the dose to 150 mg three\ntimes a day. She felt her heart was going slower than normal. This\nwas worse when standing or walking. However , she had no chest\npain , shortness of breath , loss of consciousness.

Patient has been\nmanaged medically , however , recently , the patient's heart failure\nhas progressed to the point where conventional therapy is unable to\nsustain her. The patient was admitted in September 1993 with dyspnea and\nchest pain. At that time , the patient ruled out for myocardial\ninfarction and was discharged home on exogenous oxygen therapy.\nPatient returned shortly thereafter with shortness of breath and\nwas begun on intravenous Dobutamine. She was subsequently\ndischarged home after her heart failure resolved. Patient ,\nhowever , returned a third time with similar complaints of shortness\nof breath and dyspnea and remained in the hospital awaiting a heart\ntransplant.

The patient\nwas transferred to the Intensive Care Unit immediately\npost-operatively and remained there for her first several days\npost-operatively. The patient's early post-operative course was\ncomplicated by right sided heart dysfunction and elevated PA\npressures. Echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular\nfunction. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction\npost-operatively and was managed on Dobutamine and Inocor. As PA\npressures remained elevated , the patient was switched to Milrinone\nand her other pressors were weaned off gradually. The patient had\nchest tubes left in place for approximately twelve days\npost-operatively at which time the chest tubes were discontinued.\nPatient's Swan was removed on post-operative day ten and CVP\nmonitoring was used to estimate right heart function. The\npatient's Milrinone was gradually weaned off and the patient's CVP\nremained in the 12 to 16 mm range. The patient was subsequently\ntransferred to the floor where she did well. The patient was\nbiopsied twice prior to discharge , both times demonstrating no\nrejection. Of note , the patient appeared to develop Cyclosporin\ntoxicity early in her post-operative course with rapidly rising\ncreatinine levels and elevated liver function tests. The patient\nwas placed on Trental 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. and subsequently given a\nseven day course of OKT3 after which time the patient was restarted\non her Cyclosporin with no ill effect. The patient was noted to\nhave a left sided pleural effusion that was tapped approximately\ntwo and a half weeks into the patient's post-operative period. 400\ncc of pleural fluid was removed which grew no bacteria out. The\npatient's effusion was followed by chest X-Ray and was noted again\nto reaccumulate. Approximately one and a half weeks later , a chest\ntube was placed with the recovery of approximately 700 cc of fluid.\nThis was done with ultrasound guidance. The chest tube remained in\nplace approximately five days and was subsequently removed. A\nresidual small left pneumothorax was noted.

She has a history of chest pain since the CABG. The CABG\nconsisted of a LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein grafts to the OMB-2\nand RCA. In 9/16 , she had been cathed and a 70% RCA occlusion with\na question of thrombus was seen. A 90% OMB-2 was seen; a\ncircumflex of 60% was seen; an LAD of 70% was seen. An LV-gram\nshowed inferior akinesis and posterior hypokinesis with a left\nventricular ejection fraction of 78%. Post CABG at baseline , she\nhad substernal chest pain at rest with rare use of sublingual\nnitroglycerin. She has a history of peptic ulcer disease which was\na duodenal ulcer with melena. She had an EGD in 5/20 which showed\nmild antral gastritis without ulcers. She is status post\ncolonoscopy in 9/16 which showed diverticulitis. She has a history\nof anemia with a hematocrit of 29 , MCV of 68. She was treated with\niron sulfate and H2 blockers. She noted a history in two months of\na 20 pound weight loss. One week prior to admission , she had\nmelena of loose stool. She felt light-headed. She had a cough and\nnocturia. Three days prior to admission , she noted a stabbing\nperiodic epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting twice; no coffee\ngrounds or hematemesis. She had dysphagia for months to liquids\nand solids with the sensation of aspiration on swallowing. She had\na sharp pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath.\nThe pain was similar to the inferior MI in 1988. On 2/4 , she came\nto the emergency ward , where her blood pressure was found to be\n110/68 lying and 90/palp sitting. O2 sat was 97% on room air. Her\nJVP was 9 cm with crackles at the right base. She was given three\nsublingual nitroglycerins and Maalox. Her hematocrit was 20.8.\nShe was given 10 mg of IV Lopressor from which she became\nhypotensive , but this resolved. She was transfused three units of\npacked red blood cells , given Lasix and IV H2 blockers. She went\nto the unit and ruled out for an MI by EKG and enzymes. The A-set\nrevealed a CPK of 54; B-set was 48; C-set was 36. An ABG was 132 ,\n99 , 7.43 , 33. Potassium was 4.2 , BUN 20 , creatinine 0.9.",

The lungs revealed crackles at\nthe right base one quarter. She had a kyphoscoliosis. The abdomen\nwas benign. The neuro exam was nonfocal , though she had some past\npointing secondary to poor eyesight.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-4": "HOSPITAL COURSE  On 7/5 , she was transferred to the floor. She\ncomplained of some left arm pain secondary to her\nIV , but she had no EKG changes and this improved with hot\ncompresses. She was guaiac negative. On the evening of 4/21 , she\nwas noted to be trace guaiac positive in the stool. On 7/6 at 7:30\nAM , she complained of substernal chest pain which radiated to both\nupper extremities with tingling bilaterally. This did not resolve ,\neven after giving Maalox , four sublinguals and 12 mg of morphine\nand three inches of Nitropaste. Her blood pressure was stable at\n130/80 , heart rate was 68 , and she was afebrile. Her substernal\nchest pain ranged between 7-3 , and she was given 20 mEq of Kay\nCiel. Her potassium was 3.8 , hematocrit 32.8 and stable. She was\ngiven two more units of packed red blood cells after having been\ngiven two more units of packed red blood cells between 7/5 and 10/27\nIV nitroglycerin 50 units was started after one hour and 15 minutes\nof pain. This was increased to 100 units. EKG changes were noted\nas a flattening in V4 through V6 with no ST depressions , and she\nhad a T wave down in V3 which was new since admission. On 7/6 , she\nwas transferred to the unit. Her CKs were negative; A-set was 27 ,\nB-set was 29 , C-set was 57 and D-set was 65. A catheterization\nshowed right atrial pressures of 12 , PCWP of 16 , SVR 1 , 000 , PVR 76 ,\nPA 34/14 , cardiac output 6.8. Grafts from the aorta to the OM ,\naorta to the RCA and LIMA to the LAD were all patent.

There was a mild increase in right and left sided\npressures. She was readmitted to the floor and watched. Her\nhematocrit remained stable. She had an endoscopy done on the\nmorning of 7/10 , and the impression was of a large hiatal hernia\nwith no evidence of GI bleeding at this time. It was recommended\nthat she had an upper GI and small bowel follow through or repeat\ncolonoscopy in the future as an outpatient. Her hematocrit\nremained stable at approximately 33 for the past four days.

The patient underwent echocardiography which\nshowed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of\n80%. There were no wall motion abnormalities. There was also noted\nmild left atrial enlargement and mild aortic valve sclerosis. Due\nto the worrisome nature of patient's history of angina-like\nsymptoms , she went directly to cardiac catheterization , which\nrevealed heavily calcified LAD and RCA. The LAD showed proximal\nstenosis of 30 to 40% , circumflex showed proximal stenosis of 30%\nand the RCA showed proximal stenosis of 30%. It was felt that this\nrepresented mild CAD and most likely could not explain the source\nof the patient's syncopal episode. The patient also underwent\nelectrophysiology study which showed no evidence for ventricular\narrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias as cause of syncope. The patient\ncontinued to have no arrhythmic events on cardiac monitor\nthroughout her hospital stay. The patient tolerated the cardiac\ncath well and did well during the postprocedure period. The\npatient's diltiazem was discontinued thinking that it may\ncontribute to heart block given the fact that she has a\nbifascicular block. THe patient was started on nifedipine XL.

The patient states\nthat approximately three weeks prior to admission , she developed\nincreased lower extremity edema. She also noted increased cough\nand shortness of breath. Approximately two weeks prior to the\nadmission , she doubled her Lasix dose without much improvement in\nher symptoms. About one week prior to the admission , she began\nto have abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. She continued to\nhave cough and shortness of breath at this time. The evening\nprior to presentation , she had substernal chest pain , which\nradiated to her arm x1 hour. This pain improved after taking two\nsublingual nitroglycerin tables. She presented to the emergency\ndepartment the following day complaining of shortness of breath\nand fatigue.\nIn the emergency department , the patient's vital signs were noted\nto be heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 94/40 with O2 sat 98%\non room air. She was complaining of shortness of breath and\nfatigue. Her blood pressure subsequently decreased further to\n77/48. At this time , she was bolused with IV fluids ,\napproximately 1.5 to 2 liters. Following the fluid bolus , she\ndeveloped wheezing and was treated with nebulizers. However , she\nbecame more nauseated and dyspneic and her blood pressure\ncontinued to fall. Dopamine was started for blood pressure\nsupport. When she continued to desaturate into the 80% range and\nshe was subsequently intubated. An echocardiogram at the bedtime\nshowed a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25%. In\naddition , her labs returned with an elevated troponin of 4.5.\nShe had a subsequent chest x-ray , which documented pulmonary\nedema. She was admitted for flash pulmonary edema and was\ntransferred directly from the emergency department to the cardiac\ncath laboratory. In the cath lab , her bypass grafts of the LIMA\nto the LAD and SVG to OMB were noted to be patent. However , all\nthe other grafts were occluded. No interventions were\nundertaken. She was also noted to have elevated right and\nleft-sided pressures with right atrial pressure of 32 and a mean\npulmonary artery pressure of 51 and a left wedge pressure of 40.\nShe was subsequently transferred to the CCU where she was also\nnoted to have a serum creatinine of 2.3 and making very small\namounts of urine. A pH at that time was 7.13. Her cardiac\noutput , cardiac index ratios were 6.8 to 3. She was treated with\nsodium bicarb and Lasix IV drip. Overnight , she developed a\nbrisk diuresis and her hypotension resolved. An echocardiogram\nobtained on hospital day two showed an estimated ejection\nfraction of 45%. The entire inferior wall was noted to be\nakinetic. The posterior wall was moderately hypokinetic. Global\nright ventricular systolic function was severely reduced. She\nwas also note to have a thickened , calcified mitral valve with\nsevere mitral regurgitation.\nHer CCU course was notable for two positive blood cultures , one\ndrawn on 2/21/05 and the other drawn on 4/10/05 for which she\nwas started first on vancomycin and then switched to nafcillin\nfor Coag-negative staph bacteremia.

She\npresented to the emergency department hypotensive , which was\nprobably related to dehydration due to decreased p.o. intake as\nwell as continued Lasix use. When given IV fluids , she went into\nflash pulmonary edema , requiring transfer to the CCU and\nintubation. The patient underwent emergent cath , which showed no\nnew intervenable disease , but did show severe MR. She was\nadmitted to the CCU where she was aggressively diuresed and\nweaned of the vent. She was transferred to the floor on\n4/13/05.\nHer hospital course by system is as follows.\nCardiac ischemia. The patient underwent catheterization on\n2/21/05 , which showed 100% obstruction in the SVG to RCA graft ,\n60% obstruction in the RIMA to the marginal 1 graft , patent LIMA\nto the LAD , and patent SVG to OM1 and OM2. Note was made of\nmarkedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures. No\nstents were placed. We continued management of her ischemia with\naspirin , beta-blocker , Lipitor , and Imdur. In addition , we\nstarted an ACE inhibitor , which had been initially held due to\nher hypotension. This was restarted on 10/30/05 for afterload\nreduction , given her severe mitral regurgitation. Over the\ncourse of her CCU stay and her hospital stay on the Cardiac\nService , she continued to clinically improve. We felt that her\nmitral regurgitation was likely dynamic , related to her CHF flare\nand ischemia. We would recommend outpatient echo for further\nfollow-up of her mitral regurgitation.\nRhythm. The patient at baseline has paroxysmal atrial\nfibrillation , on Coumadin. Here , she was noted to be in normal\nsinus rhythm. Her Coumadin dose was held for two nights from\n10/30/05 to 6/5/05 for planned TEE echo and a small dose of\nvitamin K was given. Subsequently , the TEE was later canceled.\nWe are therefore restarting the patient on her home dose of\nCoumadin , but her INR may rise somewhat slowly due to the vitamin\nK. We have asked her to have her labs checked on 9/13/05 for an\nINR check.\nInfectious disease. The patient was noted to have two positive\ncultures for Coag-negative staph , one drawn on 2/21/05 and one\ndrawn on 5/29/05. She was initially started on vancomycin on\n2/30/05 and then switched to nafcillin based on her\nsensitivities. The plan was to obtain a TEE to evaluate her for\nendocarditis. However , on further review of the sensitivity , we\nconclude that two bottles represent two different Coag-negative\nstaph species. We feel that this most likely represents\ncontamination rather than true bacteremia. This was discussed\nwith the ID fellow who agreed with our assessment. Therefore ,\nthe TEE was discontinued and antibiotics were also discontinued.\nWe asked that the patient have surveillance blood cultures\nchecked on 9/13/05 while off all antibiotics.\nThe patient also had a positive UA while in the CCU and was\nstarted on levofloxacin for a UTI. However , her urine cultures\nnever grew an organism. So , this was discontinued on 6/16/05.\nPulmonary. The patient has a history of COPD. She was continued\non her home inhalers as well as nebulizers as needed. She\nreceived one course of pulse dose steroids while in the CCU for\npresumed COPD infection. This was discontinued prior to her\nadmission to the floor.\nRenal. On presentation , the patient had evidence of acute renal\nfailure with creatinine elevated at 2.3. However , this improved\nwith diuresis. She also had an MRI of the kidneys to evaluate\nfor renal artery stenosis on 6/16/05. This showed severe\ndiffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta , but no\nrenal artery stenosis. The radiologist recommends a CT angiogram\nfor further work if clinically indicated as an outpatient.\nEndocrine. The patient has a history of diabetes and is on\nLantus and metformin at home. Here , we held her metformin dose\nand treated her instead with insulin sliding scale and Lantus.\nWe have asked the patient to restart her metformin upon\ndischarge.\nFEN. The patient's goal in's and out's should be even to -500 ml\nper day. We increased her home Lasix dose from 80 mg daily to 80\nmg in the morning and 40 mg at night.

Of note , during the patient's\nprevious admission , she was diagnosed with a urinary tract\ninfection as well as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis based on a\ndiagnostic paracentesis , which showed greater than 250\nneutrophils. During that admission , the patient was treated for\na urinary tract infection and the SBP and was sent home on a\ncourse of oral cefpodoxime. Of note , during that previous\nadmission , the patient was also hyperglycemic and was discharged\non an insulin regimen of Lantus 90 with good aspartate sliding\nscale. At home , the patient's blood pressures were in the 200 to\n300s and at times even higher. Over the week prior to admission ,\nit was noted that the patient gained somewhere from about 8 to 10\npounds with increasing abdominal girth and lower extremity edema.\nAs noted above , the patient's fingersticks were noted to be\nelevated in the 300s and so her Lantus was titrated from 90 units\ndaily to 100 units by the visiting nurse. The patient was\npreviously discharged on Lasix 40 mg twice daily , which was\ntitrated up to 80 mg twice daily also by the visiting nurse and\nher primary care physician. The patient had no additional\nshortness of breath , and her oxygen sat was unchanged on her home\ndose of O2. She had no chest pain , no cough , and no fevers. No\nnausea , vomiting , or diarrhea.

        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM-23": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM \n1. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with hyperglycemia and\nsugar in the 600s. The patient was initially started on insulin\ndrip at 4 units per hour , and her sugars quickly normalized. The\npatient was transitioned over to subcutaneous insulin regimen\nthat included Lantus and q.a.c. aspartate as well as sliding\nscale. The patient's fingersticks remained labile throughout\nthis admission and at times were elevated in the 300s and other\ntimes were normal in the range of 70 to 90. The patient's\ninsulin was titrated , and she was discharged on a regimen that\nincluded Lantus 90 units subcutaneously daily as well as\naspartate 28 units subcutaneously before each meal. It was\nnoticed that the patient had the most difficulty with\npostprandial sugars often after lunch and dinner. Therefore , we\nrecommended that if she continues to have hyperglycemia , that it\nwould be best to titrate the q.a.c. aspartate. It would be best\nto avoid titrating the Lantus too much given that her fasting\nsugar in the morning was often normal. The patient had no\nhypoglycemic episodes during this admission. Of note , the\npatient was not previously on q.a.c. insulin dosing at home;\nhowever , following discharge from rehabilitation , it was thought\nthat this would not likely be the best regimen for her. This was\ndiscussed with the patient's family and caregivers who were\namenable to this idea , however , will likely need further\nteaching.\n2. GI: The patient has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis\ncomplicated by ascites and esophageal varices. The patient was\nthought to be grossly volume overloaded due to her cirrhosis and\nhypoalbuminemia on admission. The patient was initially diuresed\nwith IV Lasix with good results. The patient did have a bump in\nher creatinine due to this aggressive diuresis and her Lasix was\nheld for several days , but her oral Lasix was restarted prior to\ndischarge. The patient was discharged on 60 mg of p.o. Lasix\ntwice daily. The patient on admission was thought to have\nsignificant amount of ascites based on abdominal exam. The\npatient had recently completed a course of treatment for\nspontaneous bacterial peritonitis and had no abdominal tenderness\nbut did have distention. An abdominal ultrasound was obtained as\na diagnostic paracentesis was considered given that the patient\nhad an episode of confusion; however , abdominal ultrasound\nrevealed only a small lot of ascites that was not amenable to\nparacentesis. The patient has a history of esophageal varices\nand was continued on her nadolol for prophylaxis. The patient\nwas continued on her Bactrim for SBP prophylaxis. The patient\ndid have an episode of confusion and delirium during this\nadmission , which was felt to be likely due to hepatic\nencephalopathy. The patient's delirium improved with the\ninitiation of lactulose. The patient was discharged on lactulose\n30 mL q.i.d. , which we titrated so that the patient has at least\n3 bowel movements daily. At the time of discharge , the patient\nwas alert and oriented. Of note , the patient was not started on\nAldactone for management of her volume overload given that she\nwas admitted with hyperkalemia and has a history of elevated\npotassium.\n3. Neurologic: The patient had had one episode of delirium\nduring this admission where she was confused , did not know where\nshe was , and was not interacting with her family appropriately.\nThe patient had a workup at that time , which included an\ninfectious workup , which revealed no evidence of infection. The\npatient was started on lactulose , which had to be an administered\ninitially by retention enema as she was refusing to take p.o.\nThe patient's mental status improved within 24 hours of starting\nthe lactulose , and she was continued on this regimen and will be\ndischarged on it. Of note , the patient had no asterixis on\ndischarge.\n4. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease\nwith a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.7. The patient was\nadmitted with a creatinine of 1.6 , which did increase slightly\nwith increased diuresis. The patient's Lasix was held for a day\nor two and then she was restarted on her oral home Lasix regimen ,\nwhich was titrated to 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. Of note , the patient's\nlisinopril was held on admission due to hyperkalemia. The\nlisinopril was not restarted prior to discharge given the\npatient's history of hyperkalemia and several episodes during\nthis admission , which required the administration of Kayexalate.\nThe patient likely should be on an ACE inhibitor for chronic\nkidney disease , but this can be re-added as an outpatient with\nvery close monitoring of her potassium as this was felt to be\nindicated by the patient's primary care physician. Of note , the\npatient was normotensive off lisinopril during this admission.\n5. Pulmonary: The patient has history of IPF and had no acute\npulmonary issues during this admission. The patient was\nsaturating well on her home dose of O2 throughout the entire\nadmission. The patient was continued on her home dose of\ndexamethasone for IPF.\n6. Infectious Disease: Prior to discharge , the patient was\nincidentally noted to have a urine culture that was growing\ngreater than 100 , 000 colonies. The patient was afebrile and had\nno symptoms of dysuria but did have a mildly elevated white count\nof 11 , 000. Based on the patient's recent UTI , she was started on\ncefpodoxime for a short 5-day course. Results of this urine\nculture will need to be followed up and her antibiotics adjusted\nas necessary. The patient was continued on her Bactrim for both\nSPEP and PCP prophylaxis.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-13": "HOSPITAL COURSE \nThe patient was admitted to the Windreal Claall Onli Medical Center Surgical Service on\n1/12/05 for management of her intraabdominal abscesses as a\ncomplication of recently performed partial colectomy and Hartmann\npouch for perforated diverticulitis. She was started on IV\nantibiotics with vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl. By\nsystems.\nNeuro: The patient had intermittent issues with pain control ,\nwhich were managed by putting the patient on oral narcotic agents\nas well as fentanyl patch. This seemed to help the patient's\npain. The patient also had an episode of altered mental status ,\nwhich was believed to be due to pulmonary issues of CO2 retention\nas noted below. For this reason , the patient had been\ntransferred to the ICU for 24-hour period observation , and at the\ntime of discharge , the patient was in adequate mental status\ncommunicating effectively and at her baseline. Otherwise , no\nissues at the time of discharge , except for pain control , being\nmanaged by narcotic agents.\nCardiovascular: The patient was stable throughout her\nhospitalization. However , it was notable at the time of her\nprevious admission that the patient would need to undergo an\nechocardiogram within one to two weeks. For this reason , the\npatient underwent an echocardiogram during her hospitalization\nand was found to have normal ejection fraction of 65%. There\nwere no regional wall motion abnormalities noted. Her aortic\nvalve showed trace aortic insufficiency and the patient also had\nmild degree of aortic stenosis with the valve of 1.4 cm squared.\nHer mitral valve was shown to have some degree of mitral\nregurgitation and the patient also had some tricuspid\nregurgitation as well. Her right ventricle was seemed to be okay\nand she did have some evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.\nNo evidence of gross cardiac dysfunction.\nPulmonary: The patient on hospital day #6 was found to have\naltered mental status in the evening. An ABG was checked , which\nshowed a pH of 7.42 , pCO2 of 61 , and pO2 of 58 , 92% oxygen\nsaturation on 3 to 4 liters with the base access of 12. For this\nreason , it was determined that the patient would need to be\nadmitted to the surgical ICU for further monitoring of her\npulmonary status. She was taken to the ICU and admitted there.\nDuring her ICU course , the patient was placed on BiPAP , which\neffectively brought her bicarbonate and her pCO2 levels down.\nThis did effectively decrease her pCO2. Hence by hospital day\n#8 , the patient was transferred back to the floor in stable\ncondition. From her pulmonary standpoint , the patient continued\nto have some degree of bibasilar crackles during her\nhospitalization. However , given her otherwise stable status , the\npatient was encouraged to perform and sent to spirometry and\nLasix was withheld during the later course of her hospital\ncourse. At the time of discharge , the patient was with adequate\noxygen saturation sating 97% on 1 liter at the time of discharge.",
        "GI-14": "GI  The patient had no trouble eating regular diet during her\nhospital course. Her ostomy continued to function well with the\nstoma pink and healthy. She did have two intraabdominal\nabscesses , which were drained on hospital day #2 by\nInterventional Radiology. Two IR catheters were placed and these\nwere left in place until the output was deemed to be minimal , and\na CT scan was performed as well as an abscessogram , both of which\nreveled that the fluid collections had resolved. Hence on\nhospital day #10 , the patient's interventional radiology drains\nwere discontinued without complications. At the time of\ndischarge , the patient was stable with a soft abdomen and no\nevidence of infection. The patient did have a midline abdominal\nincision open with pink granulation tissue , healing well. The\npain was treated with wet-to-dry normal saline dressing , b.i.d.\nto t.i.d.",

She was started on a five-day\ncourse of fluconazole and her Foley catheter was discontinued for\ntreatment of this infection. At the time of discharge , the\npatient was urinating adequate amounts independently without any\nissues.\nHeme: The patient's hematocrit remained stable during her\nhospital course. However , during her stay in the ICU , hematocrit\nwas found to be 27 and the patient received 1 unit of packed red\nblood cells without any complications or events.

She was evaluated and\nPipelle biopsy was unsuccessful and fractional dilation and\ncurettage revealed scant inactive endometrial tissue. This was in\nJanuary of 1994. She had a follow-up endometrial biopsy which showed\nquantity not sufficient and there was no further follow-up. All of\nthis was done outside of our offices. She saw Dr. Lamoreux for\nevaluation initially of an irregular cervix on her initial intake\ninto the Ard Onhill Hospital Medical Center system and this history\nwas reviewed. She had always had normal Pap smears. Colposcopic\nbiopsy and endocervical curettage were all negative. She had not\nat that point had postmenopausal bleeding for a couple of years.\nHer uterus was felt to be overly enlarged and ultrasound showed a\n1.9 cm irregular stripe.

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE \nThe patient was admitted to the General Surgery Service on the\ndirection of Dr. Morgan Taverner on 1/1/2005 . As mentioned\npreviously , her admission was scheduled several days prior to a\nplanned surgery in order to permit adequate evaluation by the\nPulmonary , Thoracic Surgery and Rheumatology Services in order to\nclear for her planned surgical intervention given her history of\npolychondritis. Following extensive review by the above-named\nservices , the patient was cleared for operative intervention and\nsubsequently underwent an open cholecystectomy on 6/25/2005 .\nFor detailed description of the patient's operative procedure ,\nplease see the relevant operative report.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently\ntransferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further\nevaluation and management postoperatively. Given concerns about\nher airway and for continuous monitoring given concerns about her\nbody habitus. While in the Intensive Care Unit , the patient\ncould rest well clinically without acute events. She remained\nstable from a cardiovascular standpoint and her pulmonary status\nwas noted to be stable through the duration of her initial\nadmission to the Intensive Care Unit. Following closed\nobservation in the ICU , the patient was subsequently cleared for\ntransfer to the regular patient floor on postoperative day number\none , 4/1/2005 . While on the regular floor , the patient\ninitially progressed well clinically. She was successfully\nweaned from IV analgesia and was transitioned to oral pain\nmedications without complications. She initially remained stable\nfrom a cardiovascular perspective and was noted to demonstrate a\nstable wound exam with declining liver function studies through\npostoperative day #2 , 2005.\nAt this point , once the patient was deemed stable for discharge\nto home , she demonstrated an acute episode of increased work of\nbreathing and shortness of breath with an abrupt increase in her\noxygen requirements. Despite aggressive attempts to improve\noxygenation through noninvasive means , the patient proved to\nunable to achieve oxygenation status with these measures and was\ntransferred emergently to the Intensive Care Unit for intubation.\nOf note , arterial blood gas drawn in the context of this episode\ndemonstrated a widened A-a gradient concerning for a possible\ncoronary embolus. Given the patient's habitus and her weight ,\nhowever , she was deemed inappropriate for a PE protocol scanning\nand was treated presumptively for pulmonary embolus. The\nremainder of the patient's admission was spent in the Intensive\nCare Unit and was punctuated by respiratory failure , suspected\npulmonary embolus requiring ongoing heparin therapy , development\nof intraabdominal bile leak requiring repeat exploratory\nlaparotomy and drainage procedure.\nThe subjects of the patient's admission will be further described\nby system as follows:\n1. Neurological: For the duration of her extended stay in the\nIntensive Care Unit , the patient remained adequately sedated with\nIV agents including fentanyl and Versed. Of note , the patient\nwas noted to demonstrate massive requirements of sedating\nanalgesic agents in order to provide adequate comfort. Despite\nthis , however , she was successfully weaned to a regimen of\nintermittent opioid dosing via her G-tube , which she was noted to\ntolerate without complication. With gradual withdrawal of her\nsedating agents , the patient was noted to be appropriate and\nresponsive and demonstrated no evidence of neurological\ncompromise. Of note , the patient at no demonstrated any evidence\nof acute neurological events or cerebrovascular accidents\nnecessitating further evaluation from a neurological perspective.\nAt the time of this dictation , the patient is noted to be alert ,\noriented and comfortable on an analgesia regimen consisting of\nstable fentanyl infusion and p.r.n. oxycodone. She was noted to\nmove all extremities to command , noted to be appropriate to\nquestioning , demonstrates no evidence of neurological compromise\non gross exam.\n2. Cardiovascular: The patient's Intensive Care Unit stay was\npunctuated by progressive septic physiology requiring ongoing\npressor support for a period of several weeks in order to\nmaintain adequate profusion pressures. As her intraabdominal\nprocess progressed , the patient was noted to require increasing\nsupport with multiple agents including neosynephrine and\nvasopressin; however , following appropriate surgical debridement\nof her intraabdominal bile collection , she was gradually\nsuccessfully weaned from pressor agents and at no point\nafterwards required further aggressive pressure therapy in order\nto maintain adequate pressures. She at no point demonstrated any\nevidence of acute myocardial ischemia despite multiple rule out\nprotocols in the setting of hypertensive episodes. Serial\nbedside echocardiograms demonstrated no evidence of acute\nmyocardial dysfunction or diminution of ejection fraction and she\nsubsequently was noted to stabilize from cardiovascular\nperspective. Of note , over the course of her admission , the\npatient was noted to demonstrate periodic episodes of idiopathic\nbradycardia unrelated to oxygenation status; however , she at no\npoint required external pacing or atropine therapy in order to\ntreat such episodes and was noted on all occasions as\nspontaneously resolved her bradycardic episodes. At the time of\nthis dictation , the patient is noted to be stable with regular\nrate and rhythm and no evidence of acute myocardial dysfunction.\nShe is free of pressor support and continues on a standing\nregimen of Lopressor 25 mg per J-tube q.6h. without complication.\nFollowup EKG demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and\nshe has been free of episodes of bradycardia for at least the\npast 10 days.\n3. Pulmonary: As described above , the inciting events for the\npatient's return to the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day\n#2 was noted to be acute respiratory distress secondary to\npresumed pulmonary embolus. Unfortunately , the patient's body\nhabitus precluded her from a definitive pulmonary embolus\nprotocol CT scan and she was therefore started empirically on IV\nheparin therapy in order to provide adequate anticoagulation.\nHer weight incidentally also precluded her from additional\nstudies to evaluate for evidence of pulmonary embolus including a\nVQ scan , thus her PE treatment regimen was based on empiric\nevidence only. Following institution of heparin therapy , the\npatient's oxygenation status was noted to gradually improve ,\nalthough her pulmonary status was noted to decline with\nsubsequent increase in fluid requirements given her septic\nphysiology. Serial day x-rays performed in Intensive Care Unit\ndemonstrated evidence of fluid overload through the course of her\nstay , which also likely compromised her oxygen status initially.\nGiven her ongoing requirement for pressor therapy while following\nthe development of her intraabdominal pathology , the patient was\nrecommended for a tracheostomy procedure given the expectation of\nprolonged mechanical ventilation requirements. She therefore\nunderwent PEG placement on 3/11/2005 following an extensive\ndiscussion with the patient's family regarding her likely\nprognosis. For a detailed discussion of this procedure in the\ncontext of a concomitant repeat exploratory laparotomy and\nJ-tube/G-tube insertion , please see relevant operative report.\nFollowing placement of this tracheostomy , the patient progressed\nwell clinically from respiratory perspective. Following drainage\nof her intraabdominal bile leak , the patient's septic physiology\nwas noted to gradually resolve and she was successfully weaned\nfrom pressor therapy. With cessation of her pressors , adequate\ndiuresis was rendered possible and the patient was effectively\nfluid oscillated for the duration of her Intensive Care Unit\nstay.\nWith the fluid oscillating , the patient's respiratory status\ncontinued to improve as such her serial chest x-ray demonstrated\ngradually resolving over load. With diuresis , the patient was\nsubsequently gradually weaned from pressor support to successful\ntrach collar trials , which she accomplished without complication.\nAs the time of this dictation , the patient is noted to be\ntolerating to the extended trach collar trials during the day\nwith planned ventilatory arrest at night. Her respiratory exam\ndemonstrated lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with\nmild bibasilar crackles and no additional evidence of acute\nrespiratory failure. Her trach site is clean , dry , and intact\nwith no evidence of cuff leak. The patient is successfully\ntolerating trials of a Passe Muir valve , which has provided her\nwith ability to vocalize while on her trach collar trials. A\npotential plan for trach tube downsizing has been deferred for\nthe movement given concerns about the risk of returning the\npatient to the operating room for this procedure. Given the lack\nof acute indication for such a procedure , it has been deemed best\nto defer such an intervention until such surgery deemed\nabsolutely necessary.\n4. GI: Shortly , following the patient's readmission to the\nIntensive Care Unit , she was noted to demonstrate gradually\nincreasing liver function studies suggestive for potential repeat\nbiliary obstruction. The GI Service was , therefore , enlisted to\ncome and tell me potential appropriateness of an ERCP. Following\nextensive discussions with the Gastroenterology Service , the\npatient was subsequently recommended for an ERCP to be performed\nin the operating room , which subsequently took place on\n3/11/2005 . This selection of the operating room as the site for\nintervention was informed on the basis of her inability to be\neffectively scoped in the Radiology suite given her body habitus.\nIn the operating room , the patient underwent successful\nplacement of a biliary stent with liberation of a mild amount of\nbilious fluid from the common bile duct. No sphincterotomy was\nperformed at this point. Following placement of the stent and\nsuccessful prominence of the ERCP , the patient was initially\nnoted to improve clinically with a transient diminish in her\nbiliary studies. However , shortly following , she again noted\ngradual increase in her biliary studies and gradual worsening in\nher general clinical exam associated with increasing fevers and\nseptic physiology. Serial abdominal exams were notable for\ngradual increasing abdominal distension , necessitating a return\nto the operating room on 3/11/2005 for a combined tracheotomy ,\nexploratory laparotomy , drain placement , G-tube/J-tube placement ,\nand biliary drainage procedure. For a detailed description of\nthe patient's operative procedure , please see a relevant\noperative report. Of note , the patient was noted to demonstrate\na 3-liter bile collection intraoperatively with no evidence of\nbowel injury or ischemia upon performing of this procedure.\nMultiple intraabdominal drains were placed and no evidence of\nactive bile leak was noted at the time of this procedure.\nPostoperatively , the patient progressed well clinically. Her\nbiliary function studies were noted to gradually normalize\nfollowing the drainage procedure and her abdominal exam remained\nstable for the duration of her posterior course. Following\neffective drainage of this collection , the patient's septic\nphysiology was noted to gradually correct , allowing effective\nweaning of her pressor support and marked in all organ system\nfunctions. She thereafter successfully started no tube feeds for\nnutritional supplementation , which she tolerated without\ncomplication. At all times , effective GI prophylaxis was\nprovided by Pepcid and PPI therapy. At the time of this\ndictation , the patient's GI exam remained stable. Her abdomen\nwas soft , nondistended and nontender with evidence of morbid\nobesity per her baseline exam. Her surgical incisions were noted\nto be clean , dry and intact with staples in place. Of note , her\nmidline incision was left partially opened in order to promote\nadequate wean drainage postoperatively and to permit healing by\nsecondary intervention; this incision has continued to remain\nstable with no evidence of active infection postoperatively. Her\ndrain output has gradually diminished over her postoperative\ncourse , permitting removal of one of her JP drains. Her G-tube\nand J-tube sites remained clean , dry and intact with her tubes\nremaining in place and functional. The patient is currently\nrunning tube feeds at goal via her J-tube without complication.\nHer G-tube continuous to vent appropriately without incident.\n5. GU: Following transfer , the patient to the Intensive Care\nUnit her urinary output continued to be monitored on a continuous\nbasis in order to reassess her hydration status. Through the\ncourse of her time of septic physiology , the patient demonstrated\nvariable urine output correlated approximately with her blood\npressures. With resolution of her septic physiology , however ,\nthe patient was noted to be exuberantly responsive to efforts at\ndiuresis and was quickly noted to be independently productive of\nlarge amounts of urine without diuretic therapy. She\nsuccessfully oscillated her fluids through the duration of her\nadmission , at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renal\nfailure or electrolyte abnormalities. She at no point\ndemonstrated any evidence of a hemodialysis requirement during\nthe course of her admission. At the time of this dictation , the\npatient remained independently productive of adequate amounts of\nurine in order of 700 cc per hour via her Foley catheter. Her\nelectrolytes remained stable and BUN and creatinine demonstrate\nno evidence of acute renal failure.\n6. Heme: As stated previously , the presumed etiology of the\npatient's return to the Intensive Care Unit was thought to be an\nacute , hemodynamically stable pulmonary embolism. The patient\nwas immediately started on heparin therapy , which continued for\nthe duration of her ICU stay until the point of transition to\nCoumadin therapy. Of note , the patient required large doses of\nheparin in order to provide a therapeutic PTT with hourly\ninfusion rate in order of 2000-2500 units of heparin per hour.\nFollowing prolonged heparin invasion and gradual stabilization of\nher clinical status , the patient was gradually transitioned to\nCoumadin therapy via her J-tube without complication. At the\ntime of this dictation , the patient remained borderline\ntherapeutic on Coumadin with an INR of 1.7 on a daily dose of\nCoumadin 5 mg per day. She at no point has demonstrated any\nevidence of postoperative hemorrhage or bleeding instability; her\nplatelet count has likewise remained stable for the duration of\nher stay. Although , the potential for placement of an IVC filter\nwas discussed on several occasions during the duration of her\ncurrent admission , the patient's body habitus precludes her from\neffective radiological placement of such a filter and such\nintervention is therefore been deferred at least for the time\nbeing.\n7. ID: Following transfer of the patient to the Intensive Care\nUnit , she was noted to demonstrate gradually worsening septic\nphysiology associated with spiking fevers for much of her initial\nIntensive Care Unit stay. Serial cultures of blood , sputum ,\nurine and biliary drainage were notable for evidence of near\npan-resistant pseudomonas in her biliary drainage site. An\nInfectious Disease consultation was therefore obtained. The\npatient was recommended for broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy\nconsisting of linezolid , ceftazidime , Flagyl and colistin. With\ngradual worsening of her clinical condition , the patient was\nsubsequently started on a course of Xigris for a 96-hour period\nper Xigris protocol. While on Xigris , the patient did not\ndemonstrate any appreciable improvement in her septic status and\nshe was therefore recommended for operative intervention on\n3/11/2005 as described above. Following drainage of her\nabdominal bile collection , the patient was noted to gradual\nimprove clinically with slow resolution of her septic state.\nFollowup cultures continued to demonstrate evidence of biliary\npseudomonas colonization necessitating ongoing colistin therapy.\nWith further speciation of her cultures , the patient was\nsubsequently weaned from all antibiotics except for colistin and\nunderwent placement of a PICC line for planned prolonged colistin\ntherapy. With stabilization of her clinical status , the patient\nwas subsequently restarted on her home dapsone regimen in order\nto promote PCP prophylaxis given her home immunosuppressive and\nsteroid regimen. At the time of this discharge , the patient\nremains afebrile with stable white blood cell count and no\nadditional culture information suggested for ongoing infection.\nShe has a stable and appropriately positioned upper extremity\nPICC line , which is functional and continues to permit adequate\ndosage of her standing colistin antibiotic regimen. As of this\ndictation , the patient is planned for ongoing colistin therapy\nfor several weeks pending modification by the Infectious Disease\nService.\n8. Endocrine: In the context of her ICU readmission , the\npatient was noted to demonstrate widely fluctuant blood sugars\nrequiring continues therapy with a Portland protocol insulin\nschedule. Following successful resolution of her septic\nphysiology , however , the patient was successfully weaned from\ninsulin therapy without complication and was noted to demonstrate\nstable blood sugars for the duration of her stay. Given her home\nsteroid requirement for her chronic polychondritis , the patient\nwas placed on a steroid taper for the duration of her Intensive\nCare Unit stay , which she continues at the time of this\ndictation. At no point did she demonstrate any evidence of acute\nadrenal insufficiency or thyroid dysfunction in the course of her\nadmission.\nAt the time of his dictation , the patient remains under\nevaluation for planned transfer to a vented rehabilitation\nfacility. The remainder of the patient's hospital course and her\ndischarge medication regimen will be dictated at the time of her\ntransfer by an appropriate member of the Intensive Care Unit\nteam.\neScription document: 4-9850357 EMS\nDictated By: JOCHEMS , SOLOMON\nAttending: DYE , LUTHER\nDictation ID 4002998",

For further details , please\nsee the dictated operative note. The patient was taken to the\ncardiac surgery ICU on Claseat following surgery.",
        "ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM-19": "ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM \nNeuro: The patient was alert and oriented x3 throughout his ICU\nstay. Following extubation , the patient had marginal respiratory\nstatus , so pain control was accomplished with IV Dilaudid. The\npatient had a history of chronic renal insufficiency , so Toradol\nwas avoided. When the patient was taking p.o.'s , Dilaudid was\nchanged to p.o. Dilaudid. Pain control was good with oral\nDilaudid throughout his ICU stay.\nCardiovascular: The patient was in normal sinus rhythm on\npostoperative day #1 through #3. However , the patient flipped\ninto atrial fibrillation in the 110s to 120s at 0100 on\npostoperative day #3. He was started initially on his home dose\nof 200 mg p.o. daily of amiodarone. However , later on\npostoperative day #3 , this was changed to an amiodarone drip.\nThe patient was continued on amiodarone drip at 1 for six hours\nand later decreased to 0.5 of amiodarone drip. Amiodarone drip\ncontinued from postoperative day #4 to #5. The patient remained\nin atrial fibrillation , so on postoperative day #3 at 1:00 a.m.\nto postoperative day #6 , when he converted to sinus rhythm at\n0500. The patient was transitioned to 200 mg p.o. daily of\namiodarone , which she was continued on at home after receiving\none full day of 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. amiodarone. He was\ntransferred out of the unit on 200 mg p.o. daily of amiodarone.\nThe patient was started on 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. of Lopressor. Since\npostoperative day #6 , the patient has remained in rate controlled\nsinus rhythm without any episodes of atrial fibrillation. The\npatient is also on aspirin and Zocor.\nRespiratory: The patient is status post right lower lobectomy in\n1996 for lung cancer and has a 100-year smoking history. His\nrespiratory status was marginal following extubation at 0400 on\npostoperative day #1. The patient remained on 100% high flow\noxygen from postoperative day #2 to #4. The patient required\nq.2h. nasotracheal suctioning and q.1h. chest PT in order to keep\nhim from being re-intubated. From postoperative day #2 to #4 , on\nchest x-ray , the patient's right middle lobe appeared to be\ncollapsed. There was a question of atelectasis versus pneumonia.\nThe patient was started on levofloxacin on 9/30/05 on\npostoperative day #2 , for questionable right middle lobe\npneumonia , as lobe is collapsed and the patient had extremely\nthick secretions. The patient was continued on aggressive chest\nPT and pulmonary toilet. He had a strong cough and was able to\ncough up thick secretions on his own. The patient was unable on\npostoperative day #2 to #3 to remove mask without desats into the\n70s to 80s. He was started on his nebulizers around the clock on\nAtrovent and mucomyst nebs , as well as his home inhalers of\nfluticasone and albuterol. The patient appeared to be tiring\nearly in the morning on postoperative day #3 and Anesthesia was\ncalled for an evaluation but the patient continued to struggle\nalong on 100% oxygen for two more days between BiPAP and 100%\nhigh flow oxygen. With BiPAP , patient's pO2 on his gas was\nimproved. ABGs continued improved as the patient was able to\nmobilize more. The patient is diuresed with the Lasix drip with\nimprovement in his respiratory status as well. The goal is to\nkeep patient 1 liter negative in order to improve his pulmonary\nstatus. The patient had an episode on postoperative day #3 of\n20-second loss of consciousness while getting nasotracheal\nsuction around 2300 on 8/28/05 . This was initially thought to\nbe hypoxic in origin. However , the patient had two further\nepisodes with strong cough on postoperative day #5 and #6 of 20\nto 30-second losses of consciousness with no signs of a vagal\norigin on cardiac monitor.\nBy postoperative day #5 to #6 , the patient's respiratory status\nhad improved. Diuresis was continued. The patient was given a\ndedicated triple-lumen catheter with a dedicated TPN line on\n8/20/05 , postoperative day #4 , as it was unclear whether the\npatient would turn the corner and avoid intubation , and the\npatient was also without nutrition for several days at this\npoint. The patient continued to improve in terms of his\nrespiratory status with diuresis. By postoperative day #6 , the\npatient's right middle lobe appeared to be re-expanding on chest\nx-ray. It continued to be re-expanded from postoperative day #6\nto #10 on transfer from the unit on 11/4/05 . The patient is\ncontinued on t.i.d. Lasix after his drip was turned off on\n10/22/05 . Goal was to keep the patient negative in order to\nmaximize his pulmonary status. The patient has marginal\npulmonary reserve. The patient also continues on levofloxacin\nfor a total of an 11-day course for prophylaxis against\npneumonia.",
        "GI-20": "GI  The patient is on a minced diet on transfer from the unit.\nThe patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow. On\npostoperative day #5 , 6/17/05 , a bedside evaluation was\nperformed and a video swallow was done. The patient at this time\nwas cleared for puree and thin liquids with a chin tuck. This\nwas changed to a minced diet on postoperative day #8 , as the\npatient was thought to find this more palatable. The patient was\nstarted on Nexium following extubation. TPN was started through\na dedicated port after a line change on postoperative day #4.\nThis was done , so the patient could continue getting nutrition\ndespite his marginal respiratory status. TPN was still continued\non discharge from the unit on 11/4/05 , as the patient had been\nhaving calorie counts performed by nursing in order to make sure\nthat the patient was taking in adequate nutrition prior to\ndiscontinuation of TPN. The patient continues to be in\naspiration risk , as he has very poor pulmonary status at\nbaseline. Continue calorie counts on discharge from the unit and\nNutrition will recommend stopping TPN when the patient is taking\nenough in calories orally.\nRenal: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.3. His\ncreatinine has been stable around the 1.6 to 1.8 , postop\nfollowing diuresis with Lasix. The patient was started on a\nLasix drip on postoperative day #1 in order to gently diurese\nhim. He was continued on a Lasix drip until postoperative day #9\nwith adjustments to keep him negative and per chest x-ray every\nmorning. The patient was transitioned to 20 mg IV t.i.d. Lasix\non 10/22/05 , on postoperative day #9. This was increased on\npostoperative day #10 , 11/4/05 , to 40 mg IV t.i.d. prior to\ntransfer from the unit , as the patient looked wet on chest x-ray.\nThe patient's right middle lobe appeared re-expanded on\npostoperative day #6 to #10. This is critical for patient's\npulmonary reserve. Goal will be to keep the patient negative in\nterms of his fluid balance in order to maximize his pulmonary\nstatus. His creatinine has continued to remain stable. The\npatient is urinating well and responds well to Lasix.\nEndocrine: The patient was initially placed on a Portland\nprotocol and transitioned after postoperative day #3 to NovoLog\nsliding scales with meals. At the time of transfer from the ICU ,\nhe continues on glipizide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. and then NovoLog\nsliding scale with meals and nightly. He is also on NovoLog 8\nunits subcu with meals. This will be continued on transfer.\nSugar control has been good with these agents. The patient\nremains on Levoxyl 112 mcg p.o. daily for his hypothyroidism.\nHeme: The patient was started on aspirin on postoperative day #0\nthrough his orogastric tube. This was continued on postoperative\nwith ECASA 325 mg p.o. daily , the patient's hematocrit and\nplatelets have been postop requiring no transfusions.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM \n1. Ortho: Right knee replacement. The patient underwent an\nuncomplicated right knee replacement on admission. Subsequently\nher leg was immobilized as per orthopedic recommendations. The\nreason for immobilization was that movement of the right lower\nextremity might precipitate skin tears.\n2. Skin: The patient incurred a laceration in her left calf\nperioperatively. She also incurred a skin tear on 11/29/05 with\nturning in the bed. Her skin was noted to be paper thin with\nunderlying fluid. Wound healing was impaired secondary to low\nalbumin and chronic steroid use. The patient was seen by the\nPlastic Surgery team. This team recommended appropriate\ndressings for the patient's skin tears. The team also grafted\nthe left thigh skin tear. The patient was treated with\nsupplemental vitamins to promote wound healing including vitamin\nA and zinc. She was also treated with antibiotics to prevent\nskin infections. Originally she had been on vancomycin for a\nurinary tract infection and when the course was complete for the\nurinary tract infection , the patient was switched to Keflex for\nprophylaxis versus skin infections.\n3. GI: End stage liver disease with varices and\nthrombocytopenia. The patient's complete metabolic panel and\ncoags were checked each day. During the course of her\nhospitalization , the patient's transaminases were relatively\nstable , but her alkaline phosphatase trended upward. On exam ,\nthe patient had mild right upper quadrant tenderness which she\nreported was chronic. On 5/13/05 , the patient underwent an\nabdominal ultrasound to evaluate her right upper quadrant\ntenderness and elevated alk/phos. This study revealed a 2.0 x\n1.6 x 1.6 cm hyperechoic mass in the portahepatis. This study\nalso showed evidence of cirrhosis as well as common bile duct\ndilation and splenomegaly. A CT scan to further evaluate the\nportahepatic mass was recommended. For her autoimmune hepatitis ,\nthe patient was continued on prednisone. For her varices , she\nwas continued on propranolol. Her Lasix and spironolactone were\nheld through much of her hospitalization. On 6/19/05 , her Lasix\nwas restarted in an attempt to remedy her hyponatremia.\n4. Low albumin state: The patient has a low prealbumin\nsuggestive of decreased PO intake versus decreased synthetic\nfunction of the liver. The patient also has chronic diarrhea and\nwas thought to be wasting protein. The patient refused ??___??\nplacement for tube feeds. She was initially on a house diet with\nEnsure and Boost supplements as well as MVI and lactinex\ngranules. The patient was not taking in adequate calories. On\n6/19/05 , TPN was initiated.\n5. Persistent chronic diarrhea: The patient has a history of\nchronic diarrhea. Stool studies including C. diff testing was\nnegative. The patient was also tested for celiac sprue and this\ntesting , too , came back negative. The patient was treated\nsymptomatically with Imodium.\n6. GERD: This patient was treated with Nexium and p.r.n.\nMaalox.\n7. Dysphagia: The patient reported trouble swallowing. She was\nevaluated by the Speech and Swallow team on 4/6/05. Her\nswallowing function was noted to be intact.\n8. Infectious Disease:\nPostoperative prophylaxis: Immediately postoperatively , the\npatient was initially treated with clindamycin for prophylaxis\nversus perioperative infection.\nSkin Prophylaxis: The patient was initially treated with\nvancomycin and switched to Keflex.\nUrinary tract infection: The patient had a series of dirty UA's.\nShe was ultimately treated with vancomycin for a urine culture\nthat grew out resistant staph species. She finished her course\nof vancomycin on 8/7/05. A repeat UA was noted to be positive\nfor infection. A repeat urine culture is pending.\nOdynophagia: The patient reported trouble swallowing. She was\ntreated empirically with fluconazole and clotrimazole for\nesophageal Candida. This treatment did not remedy her pain in\nswallowing. The patient then developed mouth sores. HSV swabs\nof these sores are pending. The patient was treated\nsymptomatically with viscous lidocaine.\n9. Pulmonary: The patient has a history of interstitial lung\ndisease and asthma. She was treated with Combivent and standing\nnebulizer treatments. On 8/6/05 , the patient was noted to have\na new oxygen requirement of 3 to 4 liters. Differential\ndiagnosis was PE versus pneumonia versus volume overload. On\n8/6/05 , the patient had a chest x-ray which showed left lower\nlobe atelectasis. A repeat chest x-ray on 10/17/05 was read as\nnormal. On 7/15/05 , the patient was weaned down to room air.\n10. Neuro:\nPain: The patient was treated with standing codeine sulfate.\nNausea: The patient was treated with p.r.n. Compazine.\n11. Cardiovascular:\nPump: The patient has no known heart failure. In terms of her\nvolume status , she was deemed to be intravascularly depleted as\nevidenced by prerenal urine electrolytes. She was thought ,\nhowever , to be total body volume overloaded. It was thought that\nin the setting of her low albumin , she was third-spacing fluid.\nThe patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and\nspa. On 6/19/05 , normal saline was held and the patient was\ntreated with spa in conjunction with Lasix.\nRhythm: The patient had normal sinus rhythm. She was monitored\non telemetry.\nIschemia: The patient has no known history of coronary artery\ndisease. She had no chest pain. Her cardiac markers were\nnegative. Her EKG had nonspecific abnormalities. She was\ncontinued on her beta-blocker. She was not on an aspirin given\nher thrombocytopenia.\n12. Renal: Decreased urine output. From the day of admission\nonward , the patient had relative oliguria , 500 to 900 cc of urine\nper day approximately. Her creatinine trended downward from a\nvalue of 0.5 on admission down to as low as 0.2. As noted above ,\nthe patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and spa\nversus spa and Lasix.\n13. Hyponatremia: The patient developed asymptomatic\nhyponatremia. This hyponatremia was not responsive to fluid\nrestriction. On 6/19/05 , the patient was treated with Lasix and\nspa as noted above. TSH , cortisol and uric acid were checked to\nrule out other etiologies of hyponatremia. The results of these\nstudies are pending.\n14. Endocrine: The patient has steroid induced diabetes. She was\ntreated with Lantus and sliding scale insulin.\n15. Heme: Anemia: The patient had normal iron studies , B12 and\nfolate.\n16. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is most\nlikely secondary to splenic sequestration. An antiplatelet\nfactor 4 test was sent and is pending.\n17. Anticoagulation: The patient had two indications for\nanticoagulation. The first was right total knee replacement.\nThe second was a right lower extremity superficial femoral DVT\ndiscovered on 10/16/05. The goal INR for this patient was\ndetermined to be 1.5 to 2. It was thought that the patient was\nat bleeding risk with a higher INR given her known varices and\nher thrombocytopenia. From 8/21/05 onward , the patient's INR was\nsupertherapeutic and her Coumadin was held. It was thought that\nthe supertherapeutic INR could relate to Coumadin effects versus\nnutritional deficiencies versus worsening of her function.\n18. Musculoskeletal: Osteoporosis: The patient was treated with\ncholecalciferol.\n19. Physical therapy: The patient was followed by the Physical\nTherapy team.\n20. Access: The patient had a PIC line in place.\nDischarge medications , the remainder of the hospital course and\ndisposition will be dictated by Dr. Steven Jaksic\neScription document: 2-9937431 OCA",

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-3": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 46-year-old\ngentleman with end stage renal disease\non chronic hemodialysis who was admitted status post fall and\nseizure. The patient's end stage renal disease is thought to be\nsecondary to hypertension , although he has never had a renal\nbiopsy. He has been on hemodialysis since 1987 , having dialysis\nthree times a week. His dry weight is about 85 to 86 kilos. His\ndialysis has been complicated by multiple episodes in the past of\nhypotension and seizure activity occurring after dialysis. These\nepisodes occur about once a month.\nOn the day of admission , the patient came home from routine\nhemodialysis where he was ultrafiltered 5.5 kilograms of fluid and\nhis final blood pressure after dialysis was 100/60. At noon , the\npatient went home , ate lunch and went up to his room. At that time\nhe complained of feeling dizzy and sitting on the edge of the bed\ntold his uncle that he was not feeling well and then slumped onto\nthe floor. He does not believe that he hurt himself , i.e. , did not\nhurt his head , although he did complain of some right foot pain.\nHe was still conscious as his uncle lifted him back to bed and then\nan ambulance was called.\nAfter a few minutes , the patient lost consciousness , rolling his\neyes back with some facial twitching bilaterally and tongue\nretraction. This episode lasted about five minutes. There was no\ntongue biting , no urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence. The\npatient gained full recovery of his alertness upon waking up but\nwas a bit diaphoretic. His aunt checked his vital signs which were\nblood pressure 70/40 , pulse 79. The patient had also complained of\nchest pain for a few minutes prior to his episode. When the EMTs\narrived , the patient was alert and oriented times three , cold and\nclammy , temperature 98.6 , pulse 89 , respirations 26 , blood pressure\n82/60.\nThe patient was brought to the emergency room and was orthostatic\nby blood pressure ( 10 points ) from lying to sitting. He was given\n500 ccs of normal saline and was no longer orthostatic , comfortably\nsitting up in the bed. At about 9:00 p.m. he complained of feeling\ndizzy and became diaphoretic while trying to stand up. The patient\nwas again brought into bed. He became unresponsive for one minute\nwith his eyes rolled up and some bilateral face twitching. This\nepisode only lasted about one minute. The patient was admitted for\nobservation.\nPast medical history reveals the following: 1 ) Mild mental\nretardation since about 10 years ago. 2 ) Movement disorder ( tics )\non Stelazine. 3 ) End stage renal disease thought to be secondary\nto hypertension. 4 ) Status post parathyroidectomy for secondary\nhyperparathyroidism. 5 ) Partial thyroidectomy for goiter\nincidentally found at surgery. 6 ) Status post partial gastrectomy\nfor peptic ulcer disease in the 1960's. 7 ) History of MRSA from\nwound in 1988. 8 ) Hepatitis B surface antibody positive and\nhepatitis C virus positive. Medications on admission: Calcium\ncarbonate , 1250 mg PO tid; nephrocaps , 1 PO qd; DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd;\nStelazine , 2 mg PO tid. There are no known allergies. Social\nhistory: The patient was a former smoker and has a history of\nalcohol abuse but no IV drug use. He lives with his aunt and uncle\nand is mildly retarded.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-4": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  On physical examination , vital signs\nshowed a lying blood pressure of 96/60 ,\npulse 80 , sitting up blood pressure 104/70 , pulse 96 , temperature\n97.5 , O2 sat 95% on room air. The patient was a well nourished ,\nblack male in no apparent distress. HEENT exam was unremarkable.\nNeck showed JVD of 4 cms. No lymphadenopathy. Chest was clear to\nauscultation. Heart revealed S1 , S2 , normal rate and rhythm with a\n1/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border.\nNo CVA tenderness. Abdomen was soft , nontender , no masses. Bowel\nsounds were positive. The patient was guaiac negative with brown\nstool. Extremities revealed a tender , edematous dorsal aspect of\nright foot , with full range of motion at the ankle joint. Left\nextremity benign. Neuro exam was grossly nonfocal.",

Ankle x-rays on the right revealed no fracture or\ndislocation. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 76 ,\naxis 2 degrees , some 1 mm ST elevations in I and AVL , T-waves flat\nin lead III. The slight elevations in ST were consistent with EKG\non 1/9/94.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-6": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was observed overnight and put on\nan oral renal diet , checking orthostatics\nfrequently. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout his\nhospital course and remained hemodynamically stable with no\northostasis. The patient was evaluated by the renal service who\nassessed that this episode was most likely secondary to the\nextensive fluid removal from dialysis leading to a low blood\npressure. In addition , they noted that seizures and orthostasis\nare often seen status post dialysis in some patients. They\nrecommended no further work up of this seizure episode and\nrecommended no prophylaxis with an antiepileptic. The patient\nunderwent dialysis again on 6/5/94 per schedule. After this\ndialysis , the patient was asymptomatic , not orthostatic and did not\ncomplain of any light headedness.\nAs the patient complained of right foot pain , right foot films were\nobtained which revealed nondisplaced fractures of the second ,\nthird , fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Orthopaedic service was\nconsulted who put the patient in a bivalve cast with a toe plate.\nPhysical therapy was consulted. The patient was allowed to sit in\na chair and engage in nonweight bearing activities. His foot was\nelevated on three pillows for 72 hours. The patient remained\nhemodynamically stable and now awaits placement into a skilled\nnursing facility for rehabilitation , given his casted right lower\nleg.",

The patient has a long history\nof left lower extremity DVT's. She had her first DVT approximately\nten years ago. She has had approximately one to two DVTs per year\nthereafter. According to her report , the DVTs have always been in\nthe left lower extremity. Also , her record shows that she has only\nhad DVTs in her left lower extremity. The longest duration of symptoms from a\nDVT was approximately for one to two years. She has had\nmultiple other episodes of left lower extremity swelling and pain. The\npatient states that she would not always go to the hospital for\ntreatment , but instead would self treat herself by raising her leg\nwhen immobile. Nonetheless , she has had approximately four DVTs in\nthe past year. Her last two admissions for DVTs were as follows:\nFrom 3/6 to 5/1/95 she had left popliteal and greater saphenous\nDVTs by lower extremity non invasive testing. She was discharged at\nthat time but did not fill her Coumadin prescription. She was then\nreadmitted on 3/23/95 and discharged on 1/1/95 with a left common\nfemoral DVT by lower extremity non invasive testing.\nSince the last admission , the patient adamantly states that she was\nvery compliant to Coumadin therapy. She states that she has had\nincreased pain and swelling in the left lower extremity. She also\nstates that she has been relatively active at home ( she does\ngardening , cleans the house , goes for walks ). When not active , the\npatient states that she elevates her legs.

LIMA showed left common femoral vein\nDVT , left popliteal vein DVT and distal left saphenous vein DVT.\nVQ scan was read as low probability , which was comparable to her\nprevious VQ scan in September of 1995 , which was low probability.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-17": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was evaluated for recurrent DVT and\npossible pulmonary embolus and treated with intravenous\nheparin. We had a low clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolus and the VQ scan\nwas also low probability. The patient was seen by the cardiology service to\nevaluate if the patient was a candidate for IVC filter placement.\nCardiology felt that the patient was not at risk for pulmonary\nembolus and that her recurrent DVTs were of a more result of non\ncompliance and/or never completing a full course of anticoagulation\ntherapy. Thus , the plan was to continue to anticoagulate the\npatient and follow her as an outpatient. However , the patient\ncontinued to have tooth pain and was seen by the dental service. On\n1/17/95 , she had two molars extracted , one on each side of the\nupper dentition. Her dental surgery was uncomplicated. After\nsurgery , she was continued on Heparin and anticoagulated with\nCoumadin. The patient continued to do well. However , the patient's\nhospital course was notable for multiple episodes of sudden\nshortness of breath , usually occurring during the evening. The\nshortness of breath would come on suddenly , sometimes when she was\nasleep and sometimes when she was awake. The shortness of breath\nwould last for approximately 30 minutes or so and would be relieved\nwith oxygen therapy by nasal cannula. The patient states that this\nhistory of sudden shortness of breath is usual for her and has\noccurred for several months. There were no associated symptoms of\nfevers , chills , sweats , pleuritic chest pain , chest pressure ,\npalpitations or cough. We did not suspect that she was having\nmultiple PE's. The patient was sent home with an INR of 3.2.\nIn any case , the patient was slow to respond while in house to\nanticoagulation with Warfarin. She required approximately six days\nof Warfarin at the following doses - 12.5 , 9/14 7.5 and 10 mg of\nCoumadin before obtaining an INR greater than 3.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-5": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient first underwent angiography at which\ntime they found that the vein graft was occluded.\nHe underwent tPA treatment and was brought back to angiography.\nThis time they did not find necessarily any improvement. The\nconduit actually opened but it was found that he does have a high\ngrade anastomotic stricture of the distal anastomosis. He was\ntaken to the operating room on 10/23/01 for a left lower extremity\nthrombectomy via groin and foot cutdown. Status post that\nprocedure he developed symptoms of acute chest pain and\nhypotension. An ECG was performed , as well as troponin drawn ,\nrevealing that he has an acute myocardial infarction. The\ncardiology service was called and the patient was admitted\npost-thrombectomy to the cardiac care unit. At that time he was\nmanaged medically for a few days. Based on his severe aortic\nstenosis and difficulty in managing his blood pressure , the cardiac\nsurgery service was consulted. He was scheduled to see cardiac\nsurgery in office setting but , given his current condition , we were\ngoing to perform his surgery a little bit sooner. He did have a\nbout of pneumonia which mildly delayed his surgery.\nOn 1/18/02 he underwent catheterization which revealed a right\ndominant system , a discreet 40% lesion in the proximal left main , a\ndiscreet 30% lesion in the proximal left anterior descending\nartery , 100% lesion in the first marginal branch of the left\ncircumflex artery , as well as 100% lesion in the second marginal\nbranch of the left circumflex artery. He has a discreet 80% lesion\nin the proximal right coronary artery , as well as evidence of\nsevere aortic stenosis. During catheterization this revealed an RA\npressure of 10 , a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/20 , with wedge of\n31. He had a thick cardiac output of 4.77 and cardiac index of\n2.1.\nBased on the findings of these catheterization results , the patient\nwas taken to the operating room on 2/13/02 with Dr. Opfer and Dr.\nGack for an aortic valve replacement with a #23\nCarpentier-Edwards pericardial valve and mitral valvuloplasty with\nan Alfieri suture repair , as well as coronary artery bypass graft\ntimes three with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior\ndescending artery , left radial to obtuse marginal one , and left\nradial to posterior descending artery. Postoperatively he\nunderwent our routine care and went to the Cardiac Surgical\nIntensive Care Unit where he generally did well.\nHe remained on his aspirin and Lopressor , as well as Coumadin. He\nwas mildly tachycardic and his Lopressor dose was adjusted.\nBecause of his diabetes mellitus , he was placed on the Portland\nprotocol and remained on a full ten-day course of Flagyl and\nCefotaxime for his preoperative pneumonia. On postoperative day #1\nhe was transferred to the floor where he did well and was able to\nambulate at least to a chair and was deemed that he probably is not\na candidate to go home immediately but a candidate for\nrehabilitation. He has been taken off his Portland protocol and\nhis staples have been discontinued.\nOn his pre-discharge examination he is stable with clean incisions ,\nas well as stable sternum. He is now currently on room air and\nwill be discharged to rehabilitation.",

In the last 2-3 weeks , he\nalso noted slow worsening of his exertional dyspnea. Prior to\nthis , he was rarely limited by shortness of breath , but does not\nexert himself much. Recently , however , exercise tolerance has\ndecreased to 3 to 50 feet on flat ground. Patient denied shortness\nof breath at rest until yesterday evening when he noted slight\ndyspnea also associated with a vague chest tightness. Patient\nsubsequently went to bed , slept on his usual two pillows. He woke\nsuddenly at 4:00 A.M. the morning of admission with severe\nshortness of breath , chest tightness , and a sensation of general\nfatigue. He was unable to get back to sleep because of worsened\northopnea. His daughter called the EMTs who took the patient to\nthe Pathhydenoa Ryside Community Hospital Emergency Room. His initial EKG showed a\nrate of 150 and he was loaded with procainamide after no change\nafter being treated with IV adenosine. After treatment with O2 ,\nhis chest tightness resolved. He denied nausea , vomiting ,\nlightheadedness or diaphoresis on presentation. He also denied\npalpitations during the past few weeks , but has noted episodic\npalpitations in the past. He denies any previous episodes of chest\npain or angina. In addition , he denies syncope and presyncope.",

No splenomegaly. Extremities\nshowed 3+ bilateral pitting edema. Distal pulses were not palpable\nbilaterally. Femoral pulses 2+ bilaterally. Neurologic exam was\ngrossly nonfocal. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonary\nvascular redistribution and perivascular cuffing. EKG showed\natrial flutter with 2:1 block at a rate of 135 with\nintraventricular conduction delay with right bundle branch block\npattern , as well as poor R wave progression.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-9": "HOSPITAL COURSE  1. Cardiovascular. After patient had been\ntreated with procainamide in the emergency room ,\nhe became hypotensive and was subsequently cardioverted. His blood\npressure recovered to his baseline of 90 systolic and he was\nstarted on Ace inhibitors. He was also treated with IV Lasix and\nstarted on heparin. Because of his disproportionate right\nventricular failure , he did undergo a VQ scan which was low\nprobability.\nPatient had recurrent episodes of atrial tachycardia and was loaded\norally with amiodarone. In addition , he had some short runs of\nnonsustained ventricular tachycardia.\nAfter aggressive diuresis , the patient was noted to have an\nincreasing BUN/creatinine. He was started on IV dobutamine on\n14 of July and was continued on captopril and Isordil. He diuresed well\non dobutamine and was restarted on digoxin. The dobutamine was\nweaned to off on 11 of January He was restarted on IV Lasix.\nOn 25 of August , patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a\n40% mid LAD lesion , 40% OM , 40% RCA. His pressures showed an RA\npressure of 10 , RV 50/12 , with a mean PA pressure of 34 , a\npulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , cardiac output 3.0 , with\nan index of 1.6 , SVR 1800. It was therefore felt that his\ncardiomyopathy which had initially been attributed to ischemic\netiology , was likely idiopathic or secondary to alcohol. The\npatient was subsequently transferred to the KH with Swan-Ganz\ncatheter in place. He was again treated with dobutamine and\nIsordil and his captopril was titrated upwards. Repeat echo showed\nan ejection fraction of 20% with an unstable LV thrombus. He was\nsubsequently restarted on heparin , followed by loading with\nCoumadin. He was transferred back to the floor on 2 of February and\nremained hemodynamically stable on captopril , Isordil , amiodarone ,\ndigoxin and aspirin. His Lasix intravenous was converted to p.o.\ntorsemide with good fluid balance.\n2. Neurology. The patient was noted to complain of\nlightheadedness , vertigo and ringing in his ears after receiving\nhis doses of captopril. He underwent noninvasive carotids which\nshowed a subtotal occlusion of his right internal carotid artery.\nHe underwent combined cardiac catheterization and carotid\nangiography on 11 of January Angiography revealed a greater than 90% right\ninternal carotid stenosis. Following the procedure , he had a\ntransient 5-10 minute episode of decreased responsiveness and\ndecreased left hand grip , which resolved completely. On 30 of January ,\nhe underwent right carotid endarterectomy complicated by a small\nright neck hematoma which resolved spontaneously. He had no\nfurther symptoms and was able to tolerate captopril up to 25 mg\nt.i.d.\n3. Hematology. The patient was anticoagulated with heparin\nfollowed by Coumadin as above , for his LV thrombus , with a target\nINR of 2.5 to 3.\n4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Patient's blood\nsugars were well controlled on p.o. glyburide.\n5. Renal. Patient's creatinine on admission was 1.4. His\ncreatinine transiently rose to 2.2 with aggressive diuresis , but\nfell to 1.4 on discharge.\nThe patient was discharged home with VNA services on 23 of March He\nwas stable on discharge.

Her last hemodialysis session was two days\nprior to admission , and she is usually dialyzed on Mondays ,\nWednesdays and Fridays. Interventional radiology did not perform\na thrombectomy of the right upper extremity fistula clot , as the\npatient's systolic blood pressures were in the 90s , and they were\nconcerned about the patient's change in mental status as she\nwould need conscious sedation for the procedure. She was also\nnoted upon admission to have an EKG that displayed an atrial\ntachyarrhythmia with 2:1 block that was presumed to be atrial\nflutter. Her heart rate was noted to be in the 110s to 120s , and\nthe rest of her vital signs were stable. The patient denied any\nchest pain , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , or\npalpitations. It should be noted however that the patient was\nnot entirely conversant. After speaking with the patient's son ,\nmore information was obtained about this patient's subacute\nchange in her mental status. The patient was admitted in July\nof 2004 for a fall and femur fracture. During that admission ,\nthe son stated that the patient had an acute change in her mental\nstatus such that she did not know who she was or where she was.\nShe was not answering questions appropriately. This was\npersistent during that hospital stay and was of unclear etiology.\nPrior to that admission , the patient is at baseline oriented to\nperson , place and time , and she is also very conversant. The son\ndoes admit that the patient occasionally becomes confused about\nthe day of the week. Upon discharge from that admission , the\npatient was sent to the Adtute Hospital for rehabilitation. The\nson says that over the last few months , she has become slightly\nbetter but definitely not at her baseline. He states that she is\noften disoriented to person and place , although she does answer\nsome questions appropriately. The day prior to her admission ,\nthe patient's other son visit with her at the Meretcan Hospital Of County and\ndid not notice any change in her mental status since her\ndischarge. He has noted decreased p.o. intake over the last\nmonth with the patient often refusing to eat. Upon questioning\nthe patient , she denies chest pain , abdominal pain , shortness of\nbreath , lightheadedness , and palpitations.

This TTE showed LV with a normal\nsize and moderate concentric LVH. Her LVEF was noted to be 55%.\nThere were no wall motion abnormalities. Her RV size and\nfunction was grossly normal. Her mitral valve was noted to be\nstatus post repair with a transmitral gradient of 4.0 mmHg.\nThere was trace MR. There was no change in this echocardiogram\nwhen compared to her echocardiogram from 4/7/04. The patient\nalso underwent a lumbar puncture. Her CSF was notable for an\nelevated protein. Her CSF had a normal glucose , two white blood\ncells with lymphocyte predominance , gram stain that did not show\nany organisms , and cultures that are no growth to date. On\ncytology , there were no malignant cells seen in the CSF. Her\ncryptococcal antigen was negative. CSF studies that are pending\ninclude the following: CMV culture , HSV culture , VZV culture ,\nListeria culture , HSV PCR , CMV PCR , HHV6 PCR , VZV PCR , and VDRL.\nThe cultures thus far have had no growth to date.",
        "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN-11": "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  Ms. Abrams is a 61-year-old female with a\nhistory of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy status post cardiac\ntransplant in 1991 complicated by allograft coronary artery\ndisease , post transplant MVR and TVR , and rejection , also with\nend-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , hypertension and\ndiabetes mellitus who presented with a right upper extremity\nfistula clot , new atrial flutter with 2:1 block and a change in\nher mental status that has been of many months.\n1. Cardiovascular:\nA. Pump: The patient is status post cardiac transplant and has\nbeen maintained on her outpatient immunosuppressive regimen.\nThis includes prednisone , rapamycin , and Imuran. She has\nremained euvolemic during her hospital admission.\nB. Ischemia: There were no active issues , and the patient was\nmaintained on her outpatient regimen of aspirin , statin and\nImdur.\nC. Rhythm: Electrophysiology has been seeing the patient and\nhas recommended medical management for her atrial flutter/atrial\nfibrillation with 2:1 block. The patient's heart rate ranged\nfrom the 80s to 120s , and she was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o.\nq.i.d. She seemed to respond well to the diltiazem , although it\nwas hard to measure a response since the patient often refused\nher medications. The patient was also maintained on metoprolol\n75 mg p.o. q.i.d. It was hoped that the addition of the\ndiltiazem to the metoprolol would allow for the rate control of\nthis patient's atrial arrhythmia.\n2. Renal: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease\non hemodialysis. A tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed on\n3/9/04 for temporary access for hemodialysis. She was dialyzed\nwhile in the hospital and maintained on Nephrocaps. She is\nscheduled on 11/28/04 for a right upper extremity venogram in\norder to access her anatomy for the vascular surgeons to create\nhemodialysis access.\n3. Neurology/psychiatry: The patient's change in mental status\nover the last few months is still of an unclear etiology. She\nunderwent an EEG that showed diffuse slowing that was consistent\nwith a toxic metabolic etiology. There was no seizure activity.\nShe underwent two CT scans of her head without contrast that were\nnegative for bleed. There were no changes in her CT scans when\ncompared to prior CT scan. She also underwent an LP with CSF as\nmentioned above. An MRI was not completed as the patient has an\nevent monitor in her heart. The differential diagnosis for this\npatient is changed and her mental status still includes\ndepression and pseudodementia , and we are still ruling out\ninfectious etiologies with the CSF studies that are pending at\nthe moment ( although this is unlikely ). It is hoped that she\nwill be able to follow up with neuropsychiatric testing in order\nto further evaluate her change in mental status. It should be\nnoted that during her hospital stay , the patient's level of\ninteraction with the staff varied. There were days where she was\nmore conversant and would answer many questions appropriately.\nThere were also times when the patient refused to speak with\nstaff , appeared withdrawn and refused medications and treatments.\nThe son has noted that she was actually better in the hospital ,\nappearing more conversant and interactive. It does not appear\nthat these periods of increased interaction with staff and family\nwere in any correlation with this patient's hemodialysis.\n4. Endocrinology: The patient has type 2 diabetes on insulin at\nhome. She was maintained on a sliding scale of lispro with\nfingersticks blood glucose before every meal and before sleeping.\nHer blood sugars were in control and ranged between 110 to 240.\n5. Infectious diseases: The patient has had a few low-grade\ntemperatures to the 100.0. An infectious workup did not yield\nany etiology. She has not had an elevation in her white blood\ncell count , although this may be a result of her\nimmunosuppression. Blood cultures from 7/10/04 yielded no\ngrowth. Urine was not cultured , as the patient is anuric.\n6. Feeding and electrolytes: The patient was hypercalcemic on\nadmission. This was attributed to vitamin D per the renal\nfellow. Her calcium levels were followed and trended into the\nnormal range. She was fed a pureed and honey thick diet after\nher speech and swallow evaluation indicated that the patient had\nintact swallowing function.\n7. GI: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease , and\nshe was given Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.day.",

She is to follow up with vascular surgery for a new\naccess for hemodialysis. It is hoped that she will follow up\nwith neuropsychiatric testing in order to further evaluate her\nsubacute change in mental status. The patient has three sons\nthat are very involved in her care.

Previously the patient has been\nstable with her SLE but had started Plaquenil recently. On\n9/28/99 she presented to her rheumatologist complaining of\nintermittent leg swelling for the past year and was found to have\nleft superficial femoral and gastrocnemius DVT. She was about to\nbegin Lovenox when she mentioned that she had also experienced\noccasional pleuritic chest pain over the last five years. She then had a V/Q\nscan which was read as intermediate probability for PE. For definitive\ndiagnosis , a pulmonary angiogram was done on 2/28/99 showing bilateral apical\nsmall pulmonary emboli.She was treated with IV heparin and was started on\nCoumadin to a therapeutic INR of 2.0. She also had an unremarkable\nechocardiogram at that time. On 2/30/99 , the patient returned\nwith increasing wheezing and shortness of breath. Her INR was 1.8.\nWork up revealed an intermediate probability right-sided V/Q\nmismatch with a probable new PE. Repeat echocardiogram showed no right\nheart strain. It was thought that she had had a recurrent PE in\nthe setting of subtherapeutic INR. LE DVT was stable on the LENIs.\nShe was discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin to obtain a goal INR of\n3.0. Unfortunately , two days prior to admission , the patient again\nnoted increased dyspnea on exertion. She has otherwise been\nactive , feeling well over the past week. She denies chest pain ,\nleg pain , wheezing. V/Q scan performed on the morning of admission\nshowed new mismatched lesions at the left posterior base and right\nanterior base. She notes stomach upset for the previous four days ,\nrecently had an upper GI work up , including an EGD which was\nnegative by patient's report. She denies any melena , nausea ,\nvomiting , BRPPR.

The decision to place a filter was postponed and\ninstead a pulmonary angiogram was performed. This revealed no\nobvious recurrent pulmonary embolism. The morning\nof 10/27/99 , prior to the angiogram , two\nevents occurred. First event , the patient was walking to the\nbathroom and her heart rate was noted to go at 140 beats per minute\nand was approximately sinus tachycardia or supraventricular\ntachycardia. This resolved after 45 seconds without intervention\nand did not recur and there were no associated symptoms and the\npatient was unaware of the event. The second event occurred about\none hour later and the patient noted approximately 5/10 sharp right\nlower sternal border chest pain which was not pleuritic and not\npositional and resolved spontaneously over the next 5 minutes and\ndid not recur. She also had some abdominal pain. She tolerated p.o.'s without\nany gastrointestinal\nsymptoms throughout and the pain was mild with a benign abdominal\nexam.

He was re-admitted for nocturnal\nchest pain while at rehab , and concern for myocardial ischemia. He\nunderwent cardiac catheterization that showed normal coronary anatomy ,\nsuggesting that the elevated CK-MB and troponin were likely from\nmyocarditis , as previously suspected. Notably , his chest pain was often\nassociated with shortness of breath. It was noted on his prior admission\nthat he had pleural effusions from the high volume diuresis intended to\nprotect his kidneys from myoglobin toxicity , however he had been diuresing\nwell to lasix. It was thought that his CP and SOB might be due to PND given\nhis valvular disease. Consequently , his vasoldilatory medications were\nswitched to evening dosing , his lasix dose increased , and the head of bed\nkept elevated at greater than thirty degrees. On the day after admission , he\nhad one episode of chest pain with shortness of breath , where he indicated\npain in his RUQ. A KUB was negative , as was a PE protocol CT , and he\nresponded very well to lasix. He had one further episode of SOB at night ,\nagain responsive to lasix and position. He had a repeat echo that showed\nno progression of his valvular disease from prior admission and equivalent\nEF of 70-75%. He was maintained on aspirin , labetalol , diltiazem , imdur , and\nativan prn.\n2. Arrhythmias. He was on rate control with calcium channel blockers.\nHe had several noctural few beat runs of NSVT , but no other significant\nevents.\n3. Rhabdo: He has severe polymyositis causing muscle weakness and elevated\nCK , with possible contribution from cocaine. So far , the remaining work up\nhas been negative. Preliminary biopx sy shows muscle necrosis and\nchronic inflammation along with features reminiscent of dermatomyositis. He\nwas changed back to IV solumedrol on admission , and switched to PO solumedrol\non discharge. His CK dropped from 15 , 000 on this admission to 10 , 000 , and\nthen hovered around that dose. Rheumatology Consult Fellow Gavin Nordman felt\nthis was a normal pattern under treatment , and that the true extent of\nrecovery/impairment will only be known in several weeks to months.\ndiagnosis.\n4. Renal. His Cr was maintained at 1.3-1.5 over the course of his admission ,\nlikely related to both renal damage from myoglobinuria and possibly from\nover-diureses and pre-renal phsyiology , especially in the context of BUN of\n42. His lasix dose , initially increased on admission due to excellent\nsymptomatic response with diuresis , was in the process of slow tapering at\nthe time of discharge in attempt to identify the appropriate outpatient\ndosing , with goal of maximizing symptomatic resopnse and minimizing prerenal\nphysiology.\n5.

You\ndo , however , have an inflammatory condition in which your immune system\nattacks and breaks down your muscle. As you know , the recovery process\nwill be long , and you will need to take medication for it for at least\nfour to eight weeks. Your rheumatologist , Dr Zoelle , will coordinate your\nmedication and care. You have an appointment with her in two weeks.\nAlso , you have disease afflicting the valves of your heart , and you will\nneed to see a cardiologist. You have an appointment with Dr Kissi for this\nissue. In addition , you have an appointment with your new primary care\nphysician , Dr Holverson . Please attend all of these appointments , and be\nsure to take all your medications as prescribed. Lastly , it cannot be\nemphasized enough that your health depends on the care you take of\nyourself , making sure to stop smoking , stop drinking alcohol , and stop\ntaking any illicit drugs.\nPlease seek medical attention for difficulty breathing , worsening\nweakness , black or bloody stools , or any other concerns.",

His EKG there revealed new T\nwave inversions in the inferior leads and he was admitted to the\nRexas& Hospital where he ruled out for myocardial infarction.\nWhile at Hanghab Medical Center , his EKG alternated between left anterior\nhemi-block and left posterior hemi-block. In addition , he had\nfurther episodes of nausea and diaphoresis. Because of his\nbaseline conduction system disease , an exercise tolerance test\ncould not be performed and the patient was sent for an exercise\ntolerance test thallium. However , prior to the test , the patient\nbecame diaphoretic and nauseous with a non-palpable blood pressure.\nHe was treated with an intravenous fluid bolus with subsequent\nimprovement. Because he was felt too unstable to undergo a nuclear\nimaging , he was transferred to the Hend Losblan Care to\nundergo cardiac catheterization. The patient denied any paroxysmal\nnocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , or peripheral edema. He also denied\nany recent change in exercise tolerance. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nSignificant for a history of rectal fissure , a small bowel\nobstruction , microhematuria of uncertain etiology despite an\nextensive work-up , diverticulosis , and hemorrhoids. He also has a\nhistory of degenerative joint disease and a history of mild asthma.\nHis coronary risk factors include hypertension , obesity , gender ,\nand age. ALLERGIES: None. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Calan SR 240\np.o. q.d. , Beconase two puffs b.i.d. , Brethaire two puffs q.i.d. ,\nAzmacort four puffs b.i.d. , Feldene 20 mg p.o. q.d. , and Aspirin\none p.o. q.d.",

HEENT:\nNormocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equally round and reactive to\nlight and accommodation , extraocular movements intact , and\noropharynx was benign. NECK: Supple with no jugular venous\ndistention and he had a left carotid bruit , however , his carotid\nupstrokes were normal. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.",

His\nchest X-Ray at Andsi Medical Center revealed an enlarged heart with\nno pulmonary infiltrates , his EKG from 3/6/94 at the Massbarre County Memorial Hospital revealed sinus bradycardia at 56 , left posterior\nhemi-block with non-specific intraventricular conduction delay , and\npoor R wave progression across his precordium. He had deep T wave\ninversion in III and F , this EKG was also notable for a pattern of\nalternating conduction delay with alternating pattern of left\nanterior and left posterior hemi-block.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization\non 10/16/94 which revealed hemodynamics of a\nright atrial mean of 6 , a right ventricular pressure of 28/6 , a\npulmonary capillary mean pressure of 14 , he had a totally occluded\nmid left anterior descending lesion , a tight second diagonal\nlesion , a totally occluded OM1 lesion , and a 70% distal right\ncoronary artery lesion. His left ventriculogram revealed\nanteroapical hypokinesis. On further analysis of the patient's\nEKG , it was felt that he alternated between left anterior\nhemi-block and left posterior hemi-block. It was felt that his\nsymptoms may be an indication of more advanced conduction system\ndisease that would possibly justify a pacer. At this point , the\ndecision was to monitor the patient with Holter monitoring and to\nperform a stress MIBI examination to assess if he degenerated to\nmore severe conduction disease. Holter monitoring on 1/6\nrevealed sinus rhythm between 40 and 85 , he had 14 hours of\noccasional atrial premature beats , two hours of occasional\nventricular premature beats , each lasting less than a minute , as\nwell as intermittent intraventricular conduction delay. He had no\nsymptoms during the 24 hours of Holter monitoring. He exercise\ntolerance test MIBI examination revealed a modified Bruce protocol\non which he went twelve minutes stopping secondary to leg fatigue ,\nhe had no chest pain , his maximum heart rate was 112 , his maximum\nblood pressure was 195/95 , he had no change in his baseline EKG as\nwell as no ST changes , and no arrhythmias. His MIBI evaluation\nrevealed a fixed inferior defect extending to the posterior septum.\nGiven the above information , particularly the fact that the patient\ndid not degenerate to more severe conduction system disease with\nexercise , it was felt that a pacer would not be necessary at this\ntime. Moreover , the patient had no provokeable ischemia by MIBI\nevaluation and it was felt that revascularization was unnecessary.\nThe decision then was to send the patient home on an adequate\nmedical regimen which was achieved during his hospital course via\nthe addition of Captopril to his medical regimen to provide him\nwith adequate blood pressure control. It is noteworthy that the\npatient had no episodes of nausea or diaphoresis during his\nhospitalization , that is ambulating without assistance with no\nsymptoms whatsoever. He is therefore felt to be stable for\ndischarge and is being discharged to home.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-10": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient's abdominal pain was most likely\ndue to small bowel obstruction secondary to a ventral hernia. It\nwas decided by the surgical service that the ventral hernia\nshould be fixed operatively. The medical service evaluated the\npatient , decided that her chest pain was her normal baseline\nangina and she had no acute coronary syndrome at the time of\nadmission. Recommendations were made to discontinue her\nCoumadin , allow her INR to fall to 1.8 before operating. The\npatient was also to be given generous boluses of normal saline\npreoperatively to avoid hypotension and tight blood sugar control\nduring her hospital course. The patient was admitted to the\nmedical floor before her operation and was scheduled for ventral\nhernia repair several days later. During her stay on the\nsurgical ward , the patient had developed complaints of new visual\nchanges described as objects of floating in her visual field. At\nthis point , a CT scan of the head was done to rule out an acute\ncerebral avascular accident. Head CT was initially read as\nnormal. No acute bleed. However re-read as showing a left-sided\nsub acute thalamic infarct of 10 days to 2 weeks age. At this\npoint , a neurological consultation was obtained. The neurology\nconsultant recommended an MRI/MRA of the head and neck to\nevaluate for possible hidden acute stroke and a carotid\nultrasound to assess her carotid artery patency. The MRI/MRA of\nher head was negative , a carotid ultrasound was done which was\nalso negative with no lesions similar to her previous carotid\nartery ultrasound of 10/1 A transthoracic echocardiogram was\nalso done to evaluate for atrial clots. Her echocardiogram was\nlargely unchanged from her previous echocardiogram of 2002. She\nhad normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of\n55% and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Given this negative\nworkup for any acute stroke , it was decided to obtain an\nophthalmology consult to evaluate the patient's visual changes.\nThe ophthalmology consultant attributed her visual changes to\nvitreous humor particulate matter , which is very common in older\npeople. It was most likely the cause of her visual changes. The\nophthalmology consultant recommended q.d. Pred Forte drops in\neach eye for her status post corneal transplant.\nThe patient was finally taken to the operating room on hospital\nday 7 for ventral hernia repair. The operation was uncomplicated\nwith minimal blood loss. Postoperatively , the patient's course\nprogressed well with good pain control , good progression of diet\nand good ambulation. Postoperatively , the patient was restarted\non Coumadin and placed on IV heparin for prophylaxis secondary to\nher mitral valve prosthetic. The patient remained in the\nhospital for seven days after her operation for adequate\nanticoagulation with Coumadin. On postop day 3 , the patient was\nnoticed to have bright red blood in her urine. A urological\nconsult was obtained for evaluation of gross hematuria. CAT scan\nshowed several centimeters of calcified bladder wall , which is\nindicative of infection versus tumor. However no gross tumor\nmass was observed and the remainder of her collecting system was\nnormal. The urological consult recommended follow up in Urology\nClinic in two to four weeks. The patient was then discharged on\npostop day 7 to the Awind Pitwell Medical Center for continued physical therapy.",

Overnight he was\npain free , and r/o'd by enzymes x 3. His telemetry showed NSR w/\noccasional trigeminy and PVCs. Pain may be incisional or anginal ,\nlightheadedness most likely patient's anginal equivalent. Cardiology was\nconsulted to consider the indications for catheterization and risk of ACS.\nThe patient was asx 10/3 and noted to have some sternal incisional pain\nwith palpation , no EKG changes observed. Reccomendations were made to send\nthe patient to ETT-MIBI 4/12 , check fasting am lipids , d/c home amiodarone\nfrom RH for his ? arrythmia. The patient was also started on Lisinopril\n5mg at this time and his heparin drip was d/c'd. ETT-MIBI showed no signs\nof reversible ischemia , basal wall hypokinesis but which was knwon on\nadmission. Fasting cholesterol was unable to be sent 2/2 to am MIBI\nschedule. Should be tested as outpatient.\n( P ): No signs of pump dysfunction though mildly elevated jvp of 6-8cm on\nadmission , EF post-CABG at LMVH was 43%. Repeat echo was ordered to assess\nfunction though cancelled in setting of unremarkable MIBI and absence of of\nsx and signs failure while in house.\n( R ): Alternates between NSR and trigeminy with PVCs. Amiodarone from TH\nd/c's as not needed for this rhythym.\n--Renal: h/o hematuria at MMH , microhematuria on U/A and urine sed on\nadmission. Will require outpatient follow up. Per LAH noted he would need\nrenal bx and follow-up though it does not seem appropriate w/ h/o foley and\nhematuria. Cystoscopy seems more relevant. We consulted the patient's PCP\nand agree to recommend outpatient urology follow-up over renal. Urine\ncytology was ordered and collected ( though some lost to collection during\nMIBI ). Can be followed as outpatient.\n--Pulm: cxr w/ bilateral effusions L>R but which are consistent with a\nsetting of recent cardiac surgery. Patient noted + SOB w/ pain. PE\nunlikely as infection. Exam resolved slightly over course of stay.\nPPx: Pt on heparin drip w/ ? of ACS on 9/9 , lovenox held. Haprin d/c'd 10/3\nin pm. Lovenox held as patient ambulatory and to home on 4/18\nCode: Full code",

He\nunderwent cardiac catheterization on June , 1997 , demonstrating\n90% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis , 99% diagonal\none ostial stenosis; circumflex was okay. The right coronary\nartery had a mid stenosis of 50%. The patient arrived in the\nCatheterization Lab with mild angina on 200 micrograms per minute\nof intravenous nitroglycerin. Post catheterization , the patient\ndeveloped 5/10 chest pain with an increasing pulmonary capillary\nwedge pressure to 40 and D-waves of 52. Increasing the\nnitroglycerin led to resolution of these changes. The patient had\nintra-aortic balloon pump placed via the right femoral artery with\nreturn of the wedge to approximately a mean of 6 and his pain was\nrelieved. The patient returned to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit\nwhere he underwent aggressive heart rate and blood pressure\ncontrol. He was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery and taken to the\nOperating Room on October , 1997 , for coronary artery bypass\ngrafting times three as described above. The patient was\ntransferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Electrocardiogram\nremained unchanged. He was extubated without difficulty. The\nintra-aortic balloon pump was removed. The patient was noted to\nhave slight confusion on postoperative day number one and two.\nLopressor was restarted and the patient was gently diuresed. His\nchest tubes were discontinued. On postoperative day number three ,\nthe patient was noted to be slightly more confused with left facial\ndroop and aphasia that resolved with mild left lid lag in the early\nafternoon. The patient was evaluated by Neurology. A head CT scan\nwas performed , demonstrating no hemorrhage or acute stroke. There\nwas a small left cerebellar hemisphere lesion that was believed to\nbe consistent with a lesion that was greater than 24 hours old.\nThe patient , however , became progressively encephalopathic. The\npatient underwent an echocardiogram and carotid studies , which\ndemonstrated no evidence of embolic source. The patient's\nexpressive aphasia and facial weakness , however , recurred. The\npatient again underwent head CT scan , demonstrating acute right\nparietal infarction that appeared cortically based. Given the\nrecent intra-aortic balloon pump placement , the aorta could not be\nruled out as a source for embolus. Therefore , heparin was started ,\nas was Coumadin. The goal INR is 2 to 3. Also the patient had a\nhistory of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , and although had no\nevidence of atrial fibrillation , there was concern over potential\ncardiac source for embolization. The patient's aphasia and left\nfacial droop improved steadily. He was evaluated by the Speech and\nSwallowing Service. He had no difficulty with swallowing; however ,\nit was felt that he would benefit from language therapy in addition\nto his physical therapy and occupational therapy. The remainder of\nthe patient's course was uncomplicated from a cardiac standpoint.\nHis chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated very small left\nsided effusion without any significant failure.",

He was found to have critical\ncoronary artery disease and was referred to the Cardiac Surgery\nService. The patient underwent a completion of a preoperative\nworkup and on 9/5/07 went to the operating room where Dr.\nWink performed a CABG x5. The LIMA was used to bypass the LAD ,\nthe left radial artery was used to bypass the ramus , and\nsaphenous vein was used to bypass the OM1 , PDA and LVB1. The\ncardiopulmonary bypass time was 145 minutes and the aortic\ncross-clamp time was 116 minutes. The patient tolerated the\nprocedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery\nIntensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. On\npostoperative day #1 , the patient was extubated. He complained of\nright hand weakness and numbness but was otherwise recovering\nvery well. The Neurology Service was consulted and they suggested\nthat the right hand symptoms were from surgical manipulation of\nthe chest or positioning of the arm intraoperatively.\nOccupational therapy and physical therapy were consulted to treat\nthe patient's right hand weakness and numbness. Otherwise , the\npatient was progressing very well. He was started on Lopressor\nto prevent atrial fibrillation and diltiazem for his radial\nartery bypass graft. He was off all hemodynamic drips and was in\na stable rhythm with a stable blood pressure. The patient's diet\nwas advanced as tolerated and he was producing good urine output.\nThe patient was followed very closely throughout the\npostoperative period by the Diabetes Management Service for high\nglucose levels. On postoperative day #2 , the patient's pacer\nwires and chest tubes were removed without complication. He was\nambulating and showed good postoperative progress. On\npostoperative days 3 and 4 , the patient continued diuresis for\npostoperative fluid retention. The patient's white blood cell\ncount was noted to be 13.7 and a urinalysis and urine culture\nwere sent. The urine culture grew greater than 100 , 000 colony\nforming units of gram-negative rods and he was started on\nciprofloxacin for five-day course for postoperative urinary tract\ninfection. Otherwise , by postoperative #5 the patient had\nprogressed extremely well. He was ambulating in the halls. He\nhad moved his bowels and had no difficulties with urination.\nHe had no complaints of pain. He had remained in a sinus rhythm\nwith a stable blood pressure and was oxygenating well on room\nair. The patient was ready for discharge home. The Diabetes\nManagement Service met with the patient to discuss taking insulin\nat home for his poor glucose control. He agreed to take Lantus\nat night and follow up with his primary care physician for future\nmanagement of his diabetes mellitus. On the morning of discharge\nhome , the patient's vital signs were temperature 97.7 degrees ,\nheart rate 86 in the sinus rhythm , blood pressure 110/70 ,\nrespiratory rate 20 and O2 saturation 95% on room air.

The patient had worsening\nrenal function , likely due to acute tubular necrosis secondary to\nprerenal azotemia from her initial hypotensive episodes.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was treated briefly with vancomycin\nand gentamicin. Throat culture grew out group A\nStreptococcus. She improved on levofloxacin. Renal function\nworsened likely due to acute tubular necrosis of prerenal azotemia\nsecondary to her initial hypotensive episodes on admission. She\ngradually improved to a creatinine of 1.7 on the day of discharge.\nDuring her hospitalization , she had some mild to moderate pulmonary\nedema secondary to vigorous intravenous fluid resuscitation and\nsupport of her blood pressure. She was diuresed with Lasix 20 to\n40 mg intravenously q.d. for two days with excellent response and\nwas discharged below her dry weight. Her diarrhea with nausea and\nvomiting was presumptively treated with Flagyl. However ,\nClostridium difficile was negative times two. Ova and parasites ,\nfecaliths and stool cultures were all negative. She received\nsymptomatic relief with Compazine and Imodium. The patient's\nbaseline hypertension reappeared after her blood pressures had\nstabilized and she was restarted on her outpatient regimen of\nVasotec and Cardura. Her baseline tachycardia was found to have\nbeen evidently longstanding and well tolerated with heart rate of\n100 to 120s.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-6": "HOSPITAL COURSE  This is a 72-year-old male admitted for an\nincarcerated chronic ventral hernia , postoperative day 6 , status\npost sigmoid colectomy , colostomy , and Hartmann's operation.\nHospital course was complicated by postoperative acute\nrespiratory failure , respiratory acidosis with metabolic\nacidosis , pleural effusion , hypokalemia , myocardial infarction ,\nthrombocytopenia , and delirium. He has a known history of penile\ncancer status post penectomy complicated by perineal\nurethrocutaneous fistula , chronic anemia requiring transfusions ,\nnon-insulin-dependant diabetes , hypertension ,\nhypercholesterolemia , obesity , and recurrent UTIs. The patient\nhad a suprapubic catheter placed by Urology. His postoperative\ncourse otherwise was alright. He started having atrial\nfibrillation on 7/28/07 , initially remained stable with normal\nblood pressures. He was transferred to the floor on 7/28/07 ,\nwherein he developed rapid ventricular response to 120. On\n6/6/07 , he began hypotensive with systolics of 70. Cardiology\nwas consulted. He was initially treated with Lopressor and\ndiltiazem drip. He remained hypotensive despite IV boluses. He\nwas switched to amiodarone mode and drip , but again he became\nhypotensive. Therefore he was transferred to the unit and given\na digoxin load and was transferred for a possible\nelectrocardioversion. He remained asymptomatic throughout the\nday with low blood pressures. In the ICU , he was again started\nand maintained on amiodarone IV. He tolerated it without a\nproblem. He did have an episode of bright red blood from his NG\ntube in the ICU and GI was consulted. They felt given that his\nhematocrits have stabilized after two units of packed cells , he\ndid not need to be urgently scoped. He was started on Pepcid IV\nand a Nexium drip , and had hematocrit measured q.6 h. , which\nremains normal. He was transferred back to the floor on these\nmedications and was started on TPN after a PICC line was placed\nand continued to do well. He was scoped by GI on 3/24/07 , which\nshowed diffuse gastritis thought to be due to the NG tube , and\ntwo ulcers turned out bleeding. Postprocedure , he was started on\nCarafate and was transferred to Nexium p.o. after he was taking a\ndiet. Again , his PICC line was safe on 4/15/07 and he was\nstarted on TPN on 9/25/07 .  The NG tube was removed on 3/24/07\nand his diet has been slowly advanced. He is being discharged on\nTPN as his total caloric needs are still not being met by p.o.\nnutrition and he is in good condition on discharge.\nHe was not anti-coagulated for his Atrial Fibrillation due to his risk of GI\nbleeding , as decided by GI.\neScription document: 0-8655717 CSSten Tel\nDictated By: VOCK , RODOLFO\nAttending: REGINALDO , EARLE CHANCE\nDictation ID 2930893",

It seems that your pain is likely\nmore due to your shoulder arthritis since the heart study we\nperformed was negative for blood flow problems to the heart. When you\nhave shoulder pain , you should try heat to the painful area ( or ice if\nthat helps more ) as well as Tylenol. You may also try ibuprofen in small\ndoses. Ibuprofen ( also known as Advil or Motrin ) is available in generic\nform in your drugstore. It is not good for your stomach or your kidneys\nso you should take only a very small amount as detailed in your discharge\nsummary. Because you had low blood sugar on admission to the hospital\nwe would like for you to take your diabetes pills only once a day\ninstead of twice a day until Dr. Daghita tells you differently.Your\nmedications are otherwise unchanged from your medications prior to your\nadmission. If you have weakness , shortness of breath , or\nany other concerning symptoms you should seek medical attention\nimmediately.",

She denied chest pain , discomfort , palpitations ,\nlightheadedness or syncope. She does have occasional chest\nburning. She also noted burning in her feet bilaterally which\nhas previously been attributed to neuropathy. On the day of\nadmission , she presented to the Outpatient Clinic to have an\nechocardiogram and repeat exercise stress test with oxygen\nuptake. She exercised for 4 minutes and 32 seconds achieving a\npeak heart of 90 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 100/64\nand stopping secondary to fatigue.

Given that she is already maximized on her\noutpatient diuretic dose and somewhat worsening of her renal\nfunction , she was admitted for further diuresis with IV\ntorsemide. She was also admitted for the beginning of her\ntransplant evaluation for potential cardiac transplant. She was\ninitially started on IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. with a goal of 1\nto 2 liters of diuresis per day. She was continued on digoxin\nand switched over from lisinopril and captopril. Her medications\nwere adjusted to optimize her diuresis and avoid hypotensive\nepisodes. She did go for a right heart cath on this\nhospitalization that showed increased RA pressure of 14 and a\nwedge pressure of 35-44 with V wave. Her cardiac index was\ncalculated at 1.38. Her SVR was calculated at 1600. Her mixed\nvenous O2 sat was between 52% and 60% when the readings were\nrepeated. Given that she appeared quite well and Lasix drip was\nstarted to accelerate her diuresis. She was maintained on\ntailored therapy including nitrates for afterload reduction and\nthe up titration of her captopril. She did have impressive\ndiuresis on Lasix drip. Her transplant workup at this time\nincluded PFTs that showed an FVC of 2.64 , which his 86% predicted\nan FEV1 of 1.82 , which is 75% predicted and FEV1 to FVC ratio of\n69%. Her corrected DLCO was 14.6 , which was 56% of predicted.\nShe did have as well a carotid duplex ultrasound showing no\nsignificant stenosis in either carotid artery. Her ankle\nbrachial indices were greater than 1 in both lower extremities\nand her leg pulse volume recording was all entirely normal. Her\n24-hour urine collection showed a value of 920 mg over the total\nvolume which was in the normal range. She did continued to\nrespond reasonable well to the diuresis with the exception of a\nfew episodes of asymptomatic hypotension. Her creatinine did\nbegin to bump marginally indicating that she had likely been\nslightly over diuresed. She subsequently stabilized and was\ndischarged on a stable dose of diuretics including torsemide 100\nmg p.o. b.i.d.\nHer other discharge medications include captopril 25 mg t.i.d. ,\nIsordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Claritin , Coumadin 5 mg daily , thiamine and\nmultivitamin , colchicine , magnesium , Evista , Aldactone 25 mg\ndaily , digoxin 0.125 mg daily and allopurinol 100 mg daily ,\nToprol-XL 25 mg daily.\nShe was discharged with plan for regular follow up with her\noutpatient cardiologist.\neScription document: 6-0881993 EMSSten Tel\nDictated By: TARWATER , CHARLIE\nAttending: JECMENEK , STUART\nDictation ID 7477204",

Ultrasound showed no evidence of clots in the bladder.\nElectrolytes were closely followed and adjusted appropriately\nduring the hospital course. The acute renal failure was\ncomplicated by moderate volume overload in the setting of depressed\nEF. The patient was continued on Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. Urology\nalso recommended an outpatient cystoscopy to rule out tumor versus\nFoley trauma as the cause of the patient's hematuria.\nHeme: Following cardiac catheterization , the patient developed\nepistaxis , frank hematuria , and coffee-ground emesis ( secondary to\nswallowing blood and not a GI bleed ). The hematocrit fell to 29\nand the patient was transfused with one unit of packed red blood\ncells. Heparin and Tegralen were stopped , the patient was\ncontinued on aspirin and Plavix. The hematuria resolved , and no\nclots were seen on abdominal ultrasound. The hematocrit remained\nstable throughout the rest of the patient's hospital course.\nEndocrine: For his diabetes , the patient was maintained on TZI\nsliding scale while in-house , later was restarted on his home\nregimen of insulin 70/30 , and was discharged on this home regimen.",

The patient underwent multiple interventions in her groins ,\nmostly for placement of arterial lines and intra-aortic balloon\npump. Some hematoma developed but it never worsened. Vascular\nSurgery was consulted but no further intervention was done.\n3. A very dubious diagnosis of cellulitis was done just after her\nsurgery for a redness and swelling in her leg and feet. Infectious\nDisease was consulted and they ruled out the idea of cellulitis as\nthe patient has lichen ruber planus and Infectious Disease said\nthat this was the reason for her redness. In the last two days of\nher stay in our hospital , the redness became a little bit more\nvisible , and there was some question of increased white blood\ncells , so it was decided to start her on Ancef and it should be\ncontinued for about seven more days.\n4. The patient is on three days of levofloxacen treatment for a\nurinary tract infection.\n5. When the diagnosis of cellulitis was hypothized the first time ,\na Doppler study of her lower extremity was done that showed no\nobstruction to venous flow.\n6.

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-2": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient was a 50 year old white\nmale transferred from\nRe Hospital after an episode of atrial fibrillation on\n13 of October , and unstable angina. Cardiac risk factors included\nhypertension , smoking , family history. He had a myocardial\ninfarction in 1970 , and had been basically pain-free until 1985 ,\nwhen he began experiencing stable angina , requiring one sublingual\nnitroglycerin every 2 weeks. His typical anginal equivalent is\nbilateral wrist tingling , plus some left arm or chest pressure. The\npain is brought on by exertion , relieved by nitroglycerin and rest.\nHis last exercise tolerance test with thallium was in 26 of September , when\nhe went 5 minutes on a standard Bruce protocol , and stopped because\nof fatigue. Maximal blood pressure was 165/85 , heart rate 95 , rate\npressure product 15675. He experienced his typical wrist\ndiscomfort , an his electrocardiogram showed left ventricular\nhypertrophy with strain , focal premature ventricular contractions\nand ventricular bigeminy. There was no evidence of ischemia on the\nthallium images. On 13 of October , the patient experienced a left arm\ndull ache radiating to the left side of his chest , unlike his usual\nangina equivalent. It was not relieved by nitroglycerin or by\nrest. He called his Tlakeno Rowt. Medical Center Of physician and\nwent to his local hospital. He denied palpitations , shortness of\nbreath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis. On presentation , he was\nfound to be in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate 140. He\nspontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm and sinus\nbradycardia to 55. He had no previous history of atrial\nfibrillation. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction ,\nand while in the hospital experienced 3 to 4 episodes of his usual\nanginal equivalent of wrist pain , relieved by 1 nitroglycerin each\ntime. It was unclear whether these symptoms were associated with\nelectrocardiogram changes. He received intravenous\ntrinitroglycerin at some point , and he was transferred here for\nfurther evaluation of his rest pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY revealed\nhypertension , ischemic heart disease as above , peptic ulcer\ndisease , hiatal hernia. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION at the time of\ntransfer were diltiazem 90 milligrams by mouth 4 times a day ,\nLopressor 25 milligrams by mouth twice a day , Isordil 40 milligrams\nby mouth twice a day , Lisinopril 5 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,\nZantac 150 milligrams by mouth at hour of sleep , digoxin .25\nmilligrams by mouth per day. ALLERGIES included no known drug\nallergies. FAMILY HISTORY was positive for coronary artery\ndisease. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient has a desk job at a\nfurniture store. He used to smoke 3 packs per day , quit 6 years\nago. He drinks 3 beers a week. He lives with his wife and one son\nat home , and 2 other grown children. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS was\nnegative.",

Cardiovascular examination\nshowed a III/VI systolic ejection murmur loudest at the aortic\narea , and a II/VI systolic murmur at the apex radiating halfway to\nthe axilla. Abdomen was soft , benign. Femoral pulses were 2+\nbilaterally with bruits left greater than right. Extremities\nshowed no cyanosis , clubbing or edema , palpable pedal pulses.\nNeurologic examination was nonfocal.",

The electrocardiogram\nshowed sinus rhythm at 70 , left axis deviation , left ventricular\nhypertrophy , left atrial enlargement , T-wave inversion in I and\nAVL , V5 and V6 , strain pattern. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.\nSMA-7 was within normal limits , blood urea nitrogen 13 , creatinine\n1.1.",

He tolerated the\nprocedure well with no complications. He also underwent renal\nangiography , which showed bilateral renal artery stenosis , and for\nthis he underwent bilateral renal artery angioplasty on 20 of February ,\nwhich he also tolerated well.\nRenal arteriography and angioplasty were performed becuase of drug-resistant\nhypertension and continued hypokalemia requiring K repletion even\nwhen off diuretics.

Her asthma is\ncharacterized by multiple short admissions for flares , last in\nOctober 1993 , and multiple courses of steroid tapers. At home , she\nuses Ventolin and Theophylline. Her other medical problems include\nmorbid obesity and a history of alcohol abuse. She has had\npalpitations in the past and a Holter in 4/19 showed only three\nepisodes of supraventricular tachycardia. She has also had a\nstress test in February 1992 which was a nine minute arm cycle\nstress test with maximal heart rate of 128 and systolic blood\npressure of 120. The test was negative for ischemic changes. She\nhas never had an EKG showing atrial fibrillation. She came into\nthe Emergency Ward on 8/22/94 complaining of two weeks of\nintermittent palpitations as well as shortness of breath. She used\nincreased doses of her Ventolin inhaler for this and continued on\nher Theophylline. She felt her heart fluttering quite a bit and\nintermittently , these palpitations would go away. She never took\nher heart rate during these episodes nor could she characterize her\nheart as being irregular. Prior to the palpitations beginning , she\nhad gone on a drinking binge and had drank a half a pint of brandy.\nShe has had a cough productive of whitish sputum but no change in\nthe sputum character chronically. Her asthma has been slightly\nincreasing with increased wheezing and she has been using her\ninhaler more. In the Emergency Ward , her EKG showed atrial\nfibrillation with a heart rate in the 130 range. She was\ncontrolled with intravenous Diltiazem and admitted for new onset\natrial fibrillation.

Her physical exam was significant for an\nelevated JVP , lower extremity edema , pulmonary rales , laterally displaced\nPMI , and S3 gallop , all consistent with heart failure. Even though the\npatient had cardiolmegaly on CXR from 2004 , her LVEF was about 60% ,\nsuggesting a recent development of CHF. Her EKG showed NSR with new LBBB ,\nand no QW. Due to her multiple atherosclerotic risk factors , new LBBB ,\nand evidence of neuropathy , the initial impression was that she had a\nrecent ischemic event. Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative\nduring her first 24 hours stay. She had a stress MIBI showing no\nscars or evidence of reversible ischemia with a calculated EF of 23%. An\nEcho showed dilated LV , with globaly reduced LE function and near normal\npulmonary pressures , suggestive of dilated cardiomaypathy. Extensive\ninterviewing of the patinet was negative for other possible etiologies of\nHF , TSH and A1C were normal , and and the cause of her dilated CMP\nremained undifined. she was diuresed to a dry weight of 57Kg , responded\nwell to PO Lasix ( 40-60mg ) , treated also with Toprol XL 25mg , and\nSpironolactone 12.5mg. Her symptos completely resolved both at rest and\nwith gentle ambulation. One can argue toward evaluating her coronaray\narteries either by cath or CTA to exclude balanced ischemia. However\nconsidering her age , no changed in EKGs , negative MIBI , and an Echo with\nglobaly reduced EF , we choose to medicaly treat her. she will be\nevaluated in the future for AICD/CRT , then a cath can also be considered.\nShe will follow up with Dr. Rafael Abeita .",

There is left axis deviation , a\nright bundle-branch block and Q waves in II , III and aVF , which\nis unchanged from an EKG in 5/3 .",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM  This is an 82-year-old gentleman\nwith a history of multiple medical problems most significantly\nincluding recent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis , CAD\nstatus post CABG , CHF , atrial fibrillation with a slow\nventricular response who was transferred from rehabilitation with\na fever , positive urinalysis and positive blood cultures with\nconcerns for endocarditis given his recent AVR. The patient was\ninitially started on ceftazidime and vancomycin empirically.\nBlood cultures were obtained and the patient grew out\ntwo out of two bottles of Gemella morbillorum from his blood.\nUrinary cultures were also obtained , which revealed 10 , 000\ncolonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cultures were also taken\nfrom the suprapubic catheter wound site and revealed rare MRSA ,\nfew coag-negative staph and rare enterococci. Once blood\ncultures for Gemella morbillorum returned , the patient's\nantibiotics were changed to gentamicin and ceftriaxone on\n7/17/07 .  Ceftazidime was discontinued as was vancomycin. The\npatient remained afebrile while inhouse and did not exhibit any\nsignificant leukocytosis or stigmata of endocarditis.\nSurveillance cultures obtained after starting antibiotics have\nremained negative to date. A TTE was obtained and was negative\nfor any valvular vegetation. However , given the patient's high\nrisk for endocarditis , a TEE was obtained , which was also\nnegative for any ring abscess or valvular vegetation. The\npatient , however , will be treated for endocarditis given his high\nrisk.\n1. Cardiovascular:\nIschemia: The patient had no chest pain , chest tenderness or\nchest discomfort. He does have a history CAD status post CABG\nand was continued on his full strength aspirin. He was also\ncontinued on statin.\nPump: The patient was volume overloaded at the time of admission\nand was treated with 60 mg of IV Lasix. Following this , he\nappeared euvolemic and Lasix was held for several days and then\ngradually became volume overload and was again given 60 mg of IV\nLasix and then restarted on his home dose of 80 mg p.o. QAM. At the\ntime of discharge , the patient is slightly volume overloaded , but\ndiuresing well with 80 mg daily. The patient's Losartan was held\nin the setting of his chronic renal insufficiency and initiation\nof gentamicin therapy. At the time of discharge , his weight is\n96.6 kg. His I/O goal at time of d/c is 500cc negative daily. He should\ncontinue daily weights. Of note , the patient's dry weight is\napproximately 93 kg. Pt's lasix should be titrated as he reaches his dry weight.\nRhythm: The patient is bradycardic at baseline down into the\nmid-to-low 30s , is asymptomatic and has in the past refused\npermanent pacemaker placement. All nodal agents should be\navoided for this reason. The patient did have several runs of\nnonsustained ventricular tachycardia upto 14 beats. Electrolytes\nwere checked twice daily to keep magnesium above 2 and potassium\nabove 4. However , no other medical management was initiated\ngiven his bradycardia.\n2. Infectious Disease: As noted above , there was high suspicion\nfor endocarditis in this with a recent AVR. He was found to have\nGemella morbillorum in his blood and was started as noted above\nempirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime and then changed to\ngentamicin and ceftriaxone on 7/17/07 once gram-positive cocci\nwere speciated. The patient was initially treated for\npseudomonal UTI with five days of ceftazidime , but given that\nonly 10000 CFUs grew out , it was decided that ceftazidime\ncould be discontinued and that there would be some response to\nceftriaxone plus gentamicin. A PICC line was placed on 7/17/07\nfor continued IV antibiotics and the patient should continue a\nfull six-week course of ceftriaxone and at least a two-week\ncourse of gentamicin for presumed endocarditis despite\nboth negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram\ngiven his high risk for endocarditis.\n3. GI: The patient was continued on his home dose of Protonix\nand all his stools were guaiaced and were negative in house. The\npatient should be continued on p.r.n. Colace.\n4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of insulin dependent\ndiabetes mellitus. His Lantus was titrated up to 36 units\nnightly and at that level required no sliding scale insulin.\n5. Renal: The patient was found to have a slightly elevated\ncreatinine above his baseline on admission ( 1.9 with a baseline\nof 1.1 to 1.3 ). This elevated creatinine was thought to likely\nbe due to his CHF and poor forward flow. As the patient was\ndiuresed , his creatinine decreased to 1.4 at the time of\ndischarge. Given his creatinine elevation , however , his Losartan\nwas held and this should be held while the patient is on gentamicin.\n6. GU: The patient has a history of BPH and at the time of\nadmission had a suprapubic catheter that was inserted in 4/10\ndue to difficulty to pass Foley catheter. The catheter was\nclamped and post-void residuals were checked and were only 50 mL\nand the patient was urinating without difficulty with tube clamped ,\nso Urology was consulted and suprapubic catheter was pulled\nwithout difficulty. Suprapubic wound was dressed with a sterile\ndry dressing to be changed daily.\n7. Fluids , Electrolytes and Nutrition: The patient has a\ncurrent input and output goal of 0.5 L negative daily. He is on a 2L fluid\nrestriction.\nElectrolytes. The patient has been having twice daily\nelectrolyte checks to keep his magnesium above 2 and his\npotassium above 4 given his arrhythmias while he is on 80 mg of\nLasix daily. This should be continued.\nNutrition. The patient was placed on a cardiac , 2-gm sodium\ndiet and a 2 L fluid restriction.\n8. Pulmonary: The patient is to continue on Flovent and\nalbuterol.\n9. Heme: The patient was continued on Niferex twice daily for\niron deficiency anemia. He was also found to have a very mild\neosinophilia , which should be followed.\n10. Derm: The patient was found to have a skin tear on his\nright hand. This is being treated with neomycin ointment and\nsterile dry dressing changes daily.\n11. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin\n5000 units three times daily and continued on his PPI.",

Upon catherization , two occlusions were noted in\nthe PLV: a 90% occlusion , as well as a moderate sized plaque.\nRevascularization was achieved with the placement of non-drug alluding\nstents to these lesions; the original 90% lesion was stented to 0%\nocclusion. During the catheterization , Dr. Taran noted a gradient of\n40mmHg from the thoracic aorta to the femoral aorta raising the\npossibility of this as an etiology for Mr. Mcconnell 's severe lower back pain\nand limited ability to ambulate. The catheterization was without\ncomplications.

In the intervening\nperiod she had several additional episodes of this pain and\npresented to HMC where she was treated with Disalcid and Tagamet.\nThe pain persisted in a crescendo pattern until 4/26/95 when she\npresented to LSSHA with a complaint of two days of unrelenting chest\npressure. She was sent to Ai Community Hospital where she ruled in for\nmyocardial infarction with a CK equal to 1508 MB fractions. MB of\n126 with a peak of 1900 on 8/6 EKG demonstrated Q waves in 3 and\nADF. T waves aversions of 2 ST segment depressions in V2 through\nV5. She was treated with IV nitroglycerin , heparin , oxygen ,\ndiltiazem , Metoprolol and aspirin. She apparently had additional\npain while on this regimen and was transferred to the Campte Hospital for catheterization and management.",
        "MEDICATIONS-5": "MEDICATIONS  Her medications as an outpatient were only\nhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day. Upon transfer her\nmedications included Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg once a\nday , Diltiazem CD 240 mg once a day , Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. , IV\nnitroglycerin , IV heparin , and Percocet for pain.",

Urinalysis was notable for 25 to 30 white\nblood cells , 5 to 10 red blood cells , 2+ squamous cells , 1+\nleukocyte esterase. There were no effusions or evidence of failure\non chest x-ray.",
        "HOSPITAL SUMMARY-11": "HOSPITAL SUMMARY  On admission this is a 41 year old woman with\nmultiple cardiac risk factors who ruled in for\nan inferior wall myocardial infarction and is now experiencing\npostmyocardial infarction pain either secondary to current angina\nversus pericarditis , although there was no EKG evidence to support\nthis. In the IH she was treated with heparin , beta blocker ,\naspirin. Calcium channel blocker was discontinued. IV\nnitroglycerin was continued , oxygen. The patient was scheduled for\na catheterization of the heart the morning after transfer with\npretreatment of 60 mg of Prednisone x two for history of shellfish\nallergy. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 10/12/95\nwith the results being right atrial filling pressure of 8 ,\npulmonary capillary weight pressure of 12. There was a third OM\n( first large OM was noted to have a thrombus nonobstructive with\ngood distal flow. ) The remainder of the coronary arteries were\ndeemed normal. On the 7 of October , the patient was transferred\nout of the Coronary Care Unit to the stepdown unit. Of note ,\npostcatheterization femoral pulses were 1+ bilaterally with a bruit\non the right which was there prior to catheterization. An\nechocardiogram done demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%\nwith posterior hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation. On the\n7 of October , the patient was noted to have a white blood cell\ncount of 20.7 at this time , PTT of 74.3. EKG was notable for T wave\ninversions in 2-3-S , V2 through V6 which were seen on EKG's from\n1/7 The patient's MI was felt to be consistent with a lesion\nfrom the thrombus seen on catheterization. It was thought at this\ntime that the increased white blood cell count was most likely\nsecondary to the Prednisone given as pretreatment prior to\ncatheterization. The patient's does of Lopressor was increased to\n75 mg four times a day to achieve a heart rate in the 60's. She was\ncontinued on the stepdown unit on Heparin , IV nitroglycerin and\ncontinued on cardiac monitor. On the 29 of July , the patient\nhad an episode of recurrent pain 3 out of 10 , radiating to the left\narm with no associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting , but slight\ndiaphoresis. At note , at this time , the IV nitroglycerin was being\nweaned down. Her vital signs at this event were 130/90 with a pulse\nof 80. Cardiac exam was notable for a normal S1 , S2 and S4 , no new\nmurmurs noted on exam. Lung was clear. EKG was notable to be a\nsinus rhythm at a rate of 78 with T wave inversion and 3 and R\nwhich were old , as well as ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2\nwhich were old and suitable normalization in V6. She was given one\nsublingual nitroglycerin and the IV nitroglycerin was dialed up.\nShe was likewise given 5 mg IV push of Lopressor for recontrol and\nSerax 15 mg x one. Her chest pain was reduced to 2 out of 10 with\nthese interventions with no radiation in the arm. She described it\nas a heaviness. Blood pressure was 144/87 , pulse was 74. EKG at\nthis point was notable for sinus rhythm at 75 , normal intervals. T\nwave inversions in 3R ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2 , V3 , V5\nwith T wave sinusoidality and V6 T wave slightly inverted. IV\nnitroglycerin was dialed up further , morphine 2 mg x 1 was divided\nand oxygen two liters , nasal cannula was in place. Patient was\npain-free with these interventions and a second 5 mg IV Lopressor\nwas given for better late recontrol. Duration of total episode was\napproximately 20 minutes. The pain-free EKG was notable for a rate\nof 78 wit V5 T wave more upright than sinusoidal and V6 T wave\nupright , else no change. The IV TNG was dialed up further for a\nblood pressure of 129/76 and rate was now 70. A second bolus of IV\nmorphine was obtained at this time. CK and Isoenzymes were sent\nand Cardiology attending was made aware. The patient was made NPO\nin case of any need for catheterization the following morning if\nsymptoms were to recur. The CK following this event was magnified\nwith a triponin I of 14.1. On the 29 of July it was deemed\nappropriate to continue with the IV heparin one more day and\ncontrol symptoms with IV nitroglycerin. if the symptoms were to\nincrease , it was still deemed appropriate to considering this\npatient for recurrent cath. On the 20 of February , the patient\nreturned to catheterization which demonstrated a discrete 90%\ndistal left circumflex stenosis. There was a PTCA performed of this\ndistal stenosis which left a residual 60% stenosis. A stent was\nplaced in the distal stenosis to provide a 0% residual stenosis.\nThe lesion in the proximal circumflex developed a greater than 50%\nstenosis during the procedure , and two stents were placed in the\nproximal left circumflex to provide a 0% residual stenosis for a\ntotal of three stents in place in the left circumflex. EKG's were\nstable postcatheterization. There was no remarkable hematoma in the\nright groin. CK postcatheterization was 64. On the 18 of November\nthe patient's Lopressor was changed to Atenolol and the patient was\nstarted on Coumadin for the stents. The patient at this time on\n6 of October had a heart rate in the 68 to 75 range with a\nblood pressure of 120/75% , O2 sats were 99%. As the patient was\nbeing coumadinized on the 18 of February , she had a\nsupertherapeutic response coumadinization with an INR of 5.7. The\nplan was to recheck the INR to secure a downward trend as well as\nto start planning for discharge. On the 24 of April , the INR\nwas 4.6 , demonstrating a downward trend with a subsequent maximum\nINR , while supertherapeutic , of 6.5.",

Her blood\ncultures , of note , were never positive. It was recommended by the\nID service that the patient does need an abdominal CT to rule out\nan abscess given the stranding seen on prior CT at SH , however ,\nthe patient was too large for the CT table at the Oale Hospital , as well\nas for an MRI table , it will have to be assessed as to whether the\npatient may be transferred to another facility for abdominal\nimaging to rule out abscess , until that time wet-to-dry dressings\nwill continue to the wound and antibiotics will be continued IV.\nEndocrine: The patient was given a regimen of NPH 14 units b.i.d.\nand an insulin sliding scale with excellent control of blood sugar.",
        "FEN-11": "FEN  The patient has severe protein calorie malnutrition , and a\nnutrition consult was obtained and extensive conversations were\ncarried out concerning whether or not to institute TPN or tube\nfeeds in this patient. The patient originally refused tube feeds\nand it was explained to her the risks and benefits of TPN , and a\nPICC was placed to institute TPN. However , on 6/6 the patient\nattempted to leave AMA and was declared incompetent to make medical\ndecisions , so while TPN was instituted to help support the patient\nnutritionally , at some point a feeding tube including a permanent\nPEG will have to be reconsidered , as this is the best way to feed\nthe patient. Her admission albumin was 1.5 , indicative of severe\nprotein calorie malnutrition , and her severe malnutrition was also\nthought to be the contributing , if not causative , factor to the\npatient's renal failure.\nRenal: The patient's admission creatinine was 1.2 with an increase\nto 1.9 overnight , and continued to rise to a level of 3 throughout\nher admission. A renal consult was obtained. FENA was less than 1\npercent , so renal felt that the patient's acute renal failure was\nmost likely prerenal secondary to the patient's severe protein\ncalorie malnutrition at third spacing , so it was thought that the\npatient would benefit from transfusions of blood products and/or\nalbumin to help pull fluid intravascularly. There was some thought\nthat perhaps her renal failure could have been due AIN from\nnafcillin , however , her urine eos were negative. The patient did\nhave polyuria from yeast but this was thought to be colonization\nand not actual infection. The patient did continue to receive IV\nfluids throughout this hospitalization , and her electrolytes were\nmonitored and repleted as necessary.",
        "GI-12": "GI  The patient did have some diarrhea , a C. diff was sent and is\ncurrently negative.\nPsychiatry: There were severe behavior problems with the patient\nat AMC resulting in the necessity of maintain an elaborate care\ncontract with the patient that details each behavior that was\nexpected of the patient. However , throughout her stay at GH ,\nthough she was thought to have a severely regressed personality\ndisorder , she was deemed competent to make medical decisions and\nthus left AMA from that facility. Upon arrival to Wrangwake Medical Center , she did express suicidal ideations to her niece , so a\npsychiatric consult was obtained. However , psychiatry felt like\nher suicidal ideation was most likely indicative of a borderline\ntype personality disorder , so it was not thought that she was\nactively suicidal and did not require a one to one sitter.\nHowever , she did continue to have manipulative behavior and severe\nmedical noncompliance , refusing all care including basic hygienic\ncare as well as wound dressings , medications , and interviews with\ncare providers and other medically necessary interventions. The\npatient refused multiple evaluations by psychiatry to evaluate for\ncompetence as the patient often did not want to listen when\nattempts to explain to her her medical problems and the\nconsequences concerning medical decisions were attempted. Finally\non October , the patient did try to leave AMA during the night ,\nand on the morning of March another psychiatric evaluation was\nperformed and the patient was declared incompetent by psychiatry ,\nand the decision was made to proceed with medically necessary care\ndespite the patient's unwillingness to comply , and we have begun\nthe pursuit of her guardianship for this patient. The patient's\nsister has agreed to pursue the role as her guardian. Until that\ntime , the patient will be restrained physically or chemically as\nnecessary for medically necessary intervention.

He had an electrophysiologic study at the time ,\nwhich was negative for ventricular tachycardia. In 1 of January , the\npatient reported to Hobrook Medical Center with severe congestive heart\nfailure and was transferred to Mi Hospital after\ntreatment for transplant evaluation. At Tiesi Hospital Medical Center on 3 of March , the patient's work-up included an exercise\ntolerance test with oxygen uptake of 11.1 milliliters per kilogram\nper minute , and a cardiac catheterization showing an essentially\nopen left internal mammary artery with saphenous vein grafts and\noccluded native vessels. The right atrial pressure was 10 ,\npulmonary artery pressure 54/28/30 , pulmonary capillary wedge\npressure 36 , cardiac output 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440.\nThe echocardiogram revealed severely decreased ejection of around\n15% with 2+ mitral regurgitation. Other issues included a positive\ntobacco history in the past with a moderately decreased FEV-1 of\n2.2 , and also hepatitis-C antibody positivity. The patient went\nhome after evaluation for 2 weeks and did well without fever or\nchills. He did have some constipation. For 2 days , he had some\nincreased cough when lying down similar to his previous congestive\nheart failure. The patient was readmitted on the night prior to\ntransplantation on 9 of September , for increasing congestive heart\nfailure and Dobutamine treatment. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was as\nstated above. ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. SOCIAL\nHISTORY revealed a 25-pack-year history of tobacco , none since\n1977. He has 4 children , married. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION on\ntransfer included digoxin .25 milligrams by mouth each day , Pepcid\n20 milligrams by mouth twice a day , captopril 25 milligrams by\nmouth 3 times a day , Lasix 80 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,\nEcotrin 1 by mouth each day , Coumadin , Dobutamine drip.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-3": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  The patient was a somewhat cachectic male ,\ncomfortable with oxygen. Head , eyes , ears ,\nnose and throat examination was benign. Neck was supple without\nadenopathy. Lungs were clear at the tops with bibasilar crackles.\nCardiovascular examination was notable for S1 , S2 and S3 , no S4 ,\nmurmur or rub. Abdominal examination was benign. Extremities\nshowed no edema. Rectal examination revealed guaiac negative\nstool , no mass.",
        "LABORATORY EXAMINATION-4": "LABORATORY EXAMINATION  At the time of admission , laboratory\nvalues were essentially normal , except for\nhyperglycemia , mildly increased liver function tests and creatinine\n1.1. On admission , blood urea nitrogen was 18 , creatinine .9 ,\nglucose 176 , sodium 137 , potassium 4.1 , prothrombin time 13.1 ,\npartial thromboplastin time 29 , calcium 8.5 , albumin 3.7 , magnesium\n2 , ALT 17 , alkaline phosphatase 155 , total bilirubin 1.1.\nUrinalysis was negative. Hematocrit was 38.8 , platelets 199 , 000 ,\nwhite blood cell count 8.3. The electrocardiogram revealed AV\npacing at 90. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with a pacer with\nthe wires in the right ventricle. An echocardiogram obtained prior\nto transplantation revealed right atrial pressure 10 , pulmonary\nartery 54/28/38 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 36 , cardiac\noutput 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440 , ejection fraction\n15% , 2+ mitral regurgitation.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-5": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was taken to the operating room on\n15 of November , and received an orthotopic heart\ntransplant. This was complicated by a descending aortic dissection\nfrom the iliac to the left subclavian vein secondary to femoral\ncatheterization , because the patient had had 2 previous bypasses\nand would not have tolerated aortic bypass. The patient did well\npostoperatively and was placed on Cyclosporine-A and prednisone.\nThe patient was weaned off the ventilator and Dobutamine and\ndiuresed without difficulty. Of note , one of the two preoperative\nblood cultures grew out Clostridium perfringens. Three subsequent\nblood cultures were negative , however. An Infectious Disease\nService consultation was obtained , and it was felt that intravenous\npenicillin for 10 to 14 days , 30 million units every 4 hours , would\nbe warranted given the patient's underlying immunosuppression. The\npatient underwent right ventricular biopsies according to the\nprotocol , and there was no evidence of rejection on any biopsies.\nThe patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the\naortic dissection on 11 of February , and then follow-up on 10 of March These\nrevealed a type-B dissection from the left iliac to the subclavian.\nThe ascending aorta was not involved. There was flow in both the\ntrue and false lumen on both tests. The renal , SMA and ciliac\narteries were all intact. An echocardiogram on 11 of February , revealed\ngood left ventricular function , a small amount of mitral\nregurgitation , some increased pulmonary pressures and the\ndissection of the aorta. The patient underwent abdominal\ncomputerized tomography scan to rule out any occult source of\nabscess which would be responsible for the Clostridium bacteremia ,\nas recommended by the gastroenterology consultant. No such source\nwas found. The patient's blood pressure was initially controlled\nwith Nifedipine 3 times a day 30 milligrams , until the patient\nreached the expected postoperative denervated tachycardia. After\nthis point , a beta blocker in the form of atenolol 25 milligrams by\nmouth each day was added to decrease force on the wall of the\ndissection. The patient was transferred to the Cardiology Service\nfrom the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service on 11 of February , and did well.\nAdjustments were made in his Cyclosporine dose. He was initially\ntried on some NPH insulin for hyperglycemia , but eventually with\nthe prednisone taper had good blood sugars on Glyburide 2.5\nmilligrams by mouth each day. The goal was set for the patient's\nblood pressure to be kept at all times below 140 , and this was for\nthe most part achieved. The patient was anemic during admission ,\nbut postoperatively gradually his red blood cell count increased.\nHe was started on iron sulfate to assist in his hematologic\nrecovery. B12 and folate levels were normal despite polys on\nstain. The patient's chest tube wounds were cultured during the\npostoperative course and grew normal skin flora. They were packed\nwith wicks as necessary. The left groin lymph area drained clear\nfluid and persisted , but had decreased substantially prior to\ndischarge. The patient was evaluated by the Psychiatry Service for\nsome features of hypomania on 17 of May They recommended Valium 5\nmilligrams by mouth 3 times a day to counter the steroid-induced\nhypomania. Physical Therapy Service was active in the patient's\nambulation and felt comfortable that the patient would be able to\ngo home and manage on his own.",
        "DISPOSITION-6": " The patient was discharged to home. COMPLICATIONS\nincluded aortic dissection type B from left iliac to\nleft subclavian. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were Cyclosporine-A 250\nmilligrams by mouth twice a day , Imuran 50 milligrams by mouth each\nday , prednisone 25 milligrams by mouth each day , atenolol 75\nmilligrams by mouth each day , Glyburide 2.5 milligrams by mouth\neach day , Nifedipine 30 milligrams by mouth 4 times a day ,\nSeptra-Double-Strength 1 by mouth every other day , Nystatin 15 cc\nby mouth 4 times a day , iron sulfate 325 milligrams by mouth 3\ntimes a day , Valium 2.5 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day.\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was to follow a\nlow-saturated fat , low-cholesterol , no-added-salt diet. He will\nadvance his activity as tolerated. The patient was to have a\nvisiting nurse daily until he feels comfortable with his own care.\nThe visiting nurse will assist in wound dressing changes , taking\nhis finger sticks twice a day , taking his blood pressure and\nnotifying physicians for blood pressure greater than 140. They\nwere to check differential blood pressures between right and left\narms. The patient will also receive physical therapy assistance to\ncontinue his progress in ambulation. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP\nwith the Cardiac Transplant Clinic on 28 of November , for routine\nFOLLOW-UP.\nCG507/0006\nSTAN O.

Just\nprior to his admission , he was seen by Dr. Frankie Krampitz of Harlsti Conon Memorial Medical Center cardiology and was cleared from a cardiac\nstandpoint saying that he was an average risk for surgery as he has\ndone well from his prior surgeries and has had no symptoms since\nhis bypass surgery. Additionally , his preoperative angiogram\nshowed his superficial femoral artery graft to be proximally\noccluded with mid to distal reconstitution. Above the knee\npopliteal artery , there was mild diffuse disease. Below the knee\npopliteal was patent. There was diffuse proximal disease in the\nperoneal and posterior tibial arteries. The posterior tibial\noccludes above the knee and there is high grade focal stenosis at\nthe anterior tibial origin. The dorsalis pedis is patent.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  On 2/10/99 the patient was brought to the\noperating room where Dr. Moises performed a left\nfemoral above-the-knee popliteal bypass graft. This went without\ncomplications. The type of graft used as a 6 mm Dalcron graft.\nThe immediate postoperative pulse examination was notable for a\npalpable femoral popliteal and graft pulse with a Dopplerable\ndorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse on left side. The\npatient had an ECG postoperatively that showed no significant\nchange to his preoperative ECG. He was started on heparin at 8\np.m. the day of surgery.\nOf note , on postoperative day #1 , the patient got very diaphoretic\nand nauseous. At that time an ECG was done that showed no\nsignificant change and , throughout that episode , he had no\nhemodynamic instability. This was likely secondary to having\ngotten up rather quickly and likely a vasovagal event.\nThroughout the rest of his hospitalization course the patient was\nmobilized with physical therapy. He had a Dopplerable dorsalis\npedis pulse , posterior tibial pulse , and peroneal pulse on left\nside throughout his entire hospital course. However , the graft was\nno longer palpable by postoperative day #2 but it was strongly\nDopplerable.\nThe patient was continued on heparin until his Coumadin reached the\nhigh 1 level which was achieved on 1/25/99 when his INR was 1.6. At\nthis time his heparin was discontinued. The anticoagulation is on\nfor keeping the graft patent and not for any cardiac or stroke\nreasons. The goal on his INR will be approximately 2 to 2.5. On\n1/25/99 the patient was stable for discharge. His pulse examination\nwas notable for Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior\ntibial pulse and peroneal pulse.\nThe patient's record of Coumadin in response with INR is as\nfollows: On 2/10/99 the patient was started on Coumadin at which\npoint his INR was 1.0. On that day he got 5 mg of Coumadin. The\nfollowing day , 5/27/99 , his INR was 1.1 and he got another 5 mg of\nCoumadin. On 8/17/99 the patient's INR was 1.2 and he got another 5\nmg of Coumadin. On 10/15/99 the patient got 7.5 mg of Coumadin and\nhis INR was 1.2 at that time. On 6/8/99 the patient got 10 mg of\nCoumadin and his INR was 1.6 the following day on the day of\ndischarge , 1/3/99. On the day of discharge , 1/25/99 , the patient\nwill get 7.5 mg of Coumadin and his predicted daily dose will be\nroughly 7.5 mg of Coumadin p.o. q.d.",

A\nbeta-blocker has been added back to his regimen and was titrated\nto a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. The patient has not\nbeen started on an ACE inhibitor secondary to his elevated\ncreatinine at this time. He has had no further episodes of chest\npain.\n2. Pump: The patient's congestive heart failure regimen was\ntitrated. The patient continues on Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. and\nhydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. for after load reduction. He was\nrestarted on a low-dose beta-blocker at 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. as\nwell as digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d. The patient was\naggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolyn\nfollowed by conversion to oral diuresis with torsemide at the\ntime of discharge. The patient will be followed by Dr. Rayford Hogenmiller in the Clevesa Irvca Sideenandri as well as by the\nCHF Service at Sher-ship Rimark's Medical Center . At the time of\ndischarge , the patient was felt to be nearing euvolemia with\nestimated dry weight of approximately 76 to 77 kg.\n3. Rhythm: The patient continued to have atrial flutter with a\nblock. His heart rate remained in the rate of 100 to 110 at the\ntime of discharge. He had decreased episodes of more rapid\ndysrhythmia following addition of beta-blocker and digoxin to his\nmedication regimen. He also continues on amiodarone at 200 mg\np.o. q.d. As mentioned , the patient was found to have atrial\nclot on transesophageal echocardiogram and thus was started on a\nheparin drip and transitioned on Coumadin. However , after a\nsubstantial discussion with the Congestive Heart Failure Service\nand the patient's outpatient CHF Care Team , it was felt that the\nrisks of Coumadin in this patient who has a history of\nsignificant noncompliance were greater than the known risk of\nthromboembolic disease in the setting of his known atrial clot\nand thus the patient was not continued on Coumadin\nanticoagulation. Rather , he was given aspirin and Plavix at full\ndoses. The use of Coumadin in this patient could be re-evaluated\nas an outpatient based on the patient's follow-up as deemed\nappropriate by his outpatient providers.\n4. Endocrine: The patient remained on stable diabetes mellitus\nregimen of Lantus 5 units q.p.m. and standing NovoLog 3 units\nq.a.c. as well as the NovoLog sliding scale. The patient's\ninsulin regimen can be adjusted as an outpatient and possibly\noral diabetes medications restarted.\n5. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from the pulmonary\nwith good oxygen saturations on room air at rest and with\nambulation.\n6. Renal: The patient's creatinine on the day prior to\ndischarge was 1.6 improved from the peak of greater than 2.\nRenal toxic medications were avoided. The patient had not been\nrestarted on ACE inhibitor , which could be done as an outpatient\nas his renal function stabilizes. His electrolytes were\nmonitored and repleted aggressively.\n7. Hematology: As mentioned , the decision was made not to\nanticoagulate the patient with outpatient Coumadin. He was\nstarted on aspirin and Plavix. Of note , the patient also had\ndecreased platelets in the setting of heparin anticoagulation and\nthus anti-P4 antibody was sent. This test is pending at the time\nof the dictation , but should be followed up by the patient's\noutpatient providers as it may input further treatment. In the\nmeantime , recommend no heparin products. As mentioned , the\ndecision was made by the CHF Team who will be following the\npatient as an outpatient not to continue Coumadin\nanticoagulation.\n8. Neuro: Of note , on the evening of 5/2/05 , the patient\ncomplained of left-sided blurry vision , which was new for the\npatient. He does have chronic right visual changes. In light of\nthe patient's known peripheral atherosclerotic disease and atrial\nclot , the patient was seen by the Stroke Team for a question of\nacute stroke. He had MRI at that time , which did show multiple\nold infarcts in the right frontal , right occipital , left\noccipitoparietal , left posterior frontal areas. There was ,\nhowever , no new stroke seen on the MRI. The left internal\ncarotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the MRI and\nthere was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versus\nstenosis. The patient declined any procedure such as carotid\nendarterectomy or carotid stenting for his possible carotid\nstenosis and due to this denial no workup with the CTA was done.\nIt was felt that because the patient would decline any\nintervention the risk of contrast in the setting of his acute\nrenal insufficiency would outweigh the benefits of the study.\nThe patient declined any intervention for his carotid arteries on\nseveral occasions. A carotid noninvasives were ordered and are\npending at the time of this dictation to evaluate the severity of\ndisease.\n9. Social: The patient's sister , Alexis Fernendez , is his health care\nproxy. The patient in her presence has declined coronary artery\nbypass grafting and heart transplant evaluation. The patient has\nalso declined further procedure for his probable carotid artery\nstenosis.\n10. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to the Com Medical Center for further rehabilitation. He will follow up with Dr.\nKyle Yandle in the T Las on 8/23/05 at 08:30 a.m. as well\nas with Dr. Clyde Chatampaya of Elmert Hospital\nCardiology 10/25/05. He also has a follow-up appointment with\nTRISTONTERN MEDICAL CENTER PCP , Raymond Banaag , on 8/26/05 at 01:50 p.m. The patient\nrequires substantial social support at this time , which is being\nprovided by his sister.",

When his rate was faster ,\nhe showed a left bundle-branch block.",
        "COURSE BY PROBLEM-5": "COURSE BY PROBLEM \n1. ID: There was a question of multilobar pneumonia based on\nhis recent admission for pneumonia and the appearance of his\nchest x-ray. He was initially on empiric ceftriaxone ,\nazithromycin , and vancomycin in the MICU. We discontinued the\nvancomycin. Blood cultures were clear. He weaned from oxygen ,\nand his chest x-ray cleared within 1 to 2 days. So , it was felt\nthat he had more of the component of CHF exacerbation. He\ncompleted a short 7-day course of azithromycin.\n2. Cardiovascular:\nI. Ischemia: He has extensive CAD and showed an elevated CK ,\ntroponin , and a new left bundle branch in the setting of\nhypotension. This was felt to be a demand ischemia. His enzymes were\nelevated with his troponin remaining elevated at 5 , but the MB had\ndecreased from 18 to 2 rapidly. The cardiology consultants felt\nthat this was demand ischemia as the left bundle-branch block was\nrate dependent and recommended continued medical management. He\nis already on therapeutic-dose Lovenox for his history of CVA.\nII. Pump: He initially had hypertension in the unit. This\nresolved and he appeared euvolemic on his home dose of 20 mg of\nLasix daily. A repeat echo revealed no changes.\nIII. Rhythm: As mentioned above , he exhibited a new left\nbundle-branch block in the setting of tachycardia but decreased\nrate.\n3. Heme: Initially had bleeding from his left subclavian site\nin the setting of his anticoagulation; it resolved. Spoke with\nthe vascular wervice who recommended holding one dose of Lovenox when the\nline was removed. This was done , and the line was removed\nsuccessfully without any bleeding.\n4. Renal: He has chronic renal insufficiency. His creatinine\nremained at baseline of 1.2 to 1.5.\n5. Neuro: He has a history of multiple CVAs. We kept him on\nhis treatment-dose Lovenox other than being held for 1 dose to\nremove the line. He has seizure disorder. He is on Keppra. He\nhas a history of sundowning and was placed on Zyprexa briefly but\nthis was weaned.\n6. Endo: At home , Mr. Vanzie was on oral medications. He was\nstarted on Lantus and lispro and we decided to send him on Lantus\nas well as some a.c. NovoLog as well.\nMr. Sindel was discharged home with services with followup\nappointments with Dr. Willie Saale on 3/30/2006 at 1330 hours ,\nDr. Demaine on 5/11/2006 at 1550 hours , and with Dr.\nMalmanger on 11/8/2006 at 1400 hours.",

En route to the ER , he suffered a ventricular\nfibrillation arrest , was defibrillated x1 with 120 Joules to a\nrhythm of pulseless electrical activity. He then received fluids\nand lidocaine bolus and he recovered his pulse and blood pressure\nand was intubated in the field.\nOf note , the patient had an AVR Bjork-Shiley and saphenous vein\ngraft to LAD and left circumflex sequential grafting , original\nsurgery in 1982. In 1985 , he underwent reoperation with\nsaphenous vein graft to LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM2. He\nhas had multiple admissions to Estatewentlung Lufirm Community Medical Center in the past\nyear. In September 2003 , he was admitted with chest pain. He ruled in\nfor a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and was taken to the\ncatheterization lab. At the cath lab in September 2003 , at Dotonh/ Medical Center he had a left main with a tight ostial lesion.\nHe had saphenous vein graft to LAD , it was patent , saphenous vein\ngraft to OM2 was patent with a tight 95% stenosis proximally in\nOM2 at the touchdown site inhibiting retrograde profusion. It\nwas determined at this point that PCI would be inappropriate. At\nthat time and echo showed an EF of 25% with moderate mitral\nregurgitation and right ventricular systolic pressures of 47. He\nwas medically managed on nitrates , an ACE inhibitor ,\nbeta-blocker , digoxin , and Lasix. Per his wife , he had been\ndoing well since April of 2003 , only sublingual nitrogens on\noccasion , but today , on the day of admission he ate lunch with\nhis son and then developed his typical substernal chest pain , but\nthis time did not have relief with sublingual nitrogen x 3. He\ncalled EMS who arrived at the scene and he had the following code\nstatus mentioned above with a VF arrest and then a PEA arrest.\nOn arrival to Tonwa Medical Center he had a heart rate of 132 , blood\npressure 89/61 , and respiratory rate 28. He was given normal\nsaline 2 liters , dopamine drip , Lopressor 5 mg IV push , and he\nwas paralyzed , at which point it was determined that the patient\nwould likely need urgent cardiac catheterization for suspected\nmyocardial infarction. He was transferred the Specce Health Care Cardiac Cath lab emergently.",

He was\nintubated and sedated. His JVP was 12 cm of water. He had a\nregular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. No murmurs , rubs ,\nor gallops. He had a mechanical S2. His abdomen was soft ,\nnontender , and nondistended. Bilateral lower extremities were\ncool and clammy with 1+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally. He had\necchymosis as a result of his Coumadin use.\nInitial labs were significant for a glucose of 220 , a CK of 565\nwith an MB of 74 and troponin of 14.0. Hematocrit was 48. His\nINR was 1.7. Chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate.\nEKG with sinus rhythm and a left bundle-branch block with right\naxis deviation.

He had mild MR\nand aortic radiant of 27/16. The right ventricular systolic\nfunction is normal.\nIn summary , the patient is a 60-year-old male with chronic\ncoronary artery disease , now status post a VF arrest in the\nsetting of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with isolated ST\nelevation in V3. He was admitted for critical care to the\nCardiac Intensive Care Unit at Lungken Medical Center .",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM \n1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was transferred\nemergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where\ncatheterization revealed severe native 3VD and vein graft\ndisease. His left main is moderately sized with a distal 60%\nlesion. The mid LAD was proximally occluded after the first\nsepta. His left circumference is proximally occluded. The\ndistal LAD after vein graft is without significant disease and\nthe distal OM branch after the vein graft is diffusely diseased\nwith focal 99% lesion after the distal anastomosis. Saphenous\nvein graft to LAD is patent , saphenous vein graft to OM has 99%\nlesion in distal anastomosis with _____ flow and a tilting disk\naortic valve that appears to be functioning normally. In\nsummary , the patient had what was considered to be a\nnonintervenable coronary artery disease and thus he was admitted\nfor medical management. He received optimal medical management\nfor his acute myocardial infarction including aspirin and Plavix ,\nstatin , beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor as tolerated. His ischemic\nEKG changes have resolved at the time of transfer out of the\nCoronary Care Unit and he has been chest pain-free for the\nremainder of that day. His CK peaked at 1090 on 6/17/03 . Pump:\nThe patient was anticoagulated with heparin for a goal PTT of\n6084 for his Bjork-Shiley valve. His Coumadin was held in the\nsetting. He had a TTE on 6/17/03 , which showed a left\nventricular ejection fraction of 25% with inferoposterior HK ,\nleft atrial enlargement , mild to moderate MR , and well-seated\nAVR. The patient was rapidly weaned off dopamine and\nNeo-Synephrine during his ICU stay and he was transferred out to\nthe floor , once he was considered to be euvolemic. Rhythm: As\nnoted above , the patient admitted with status post VF arrest. He\nwas successfully defibrillated out of that with shock x 1.\nHowever , his course was complicated by an episode of atrial\nfibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to the 160s\nassociated with hypotension for which he was electively\ncardioverted with shock x 1 to normal sinus rhythm after which he\nwas loaded with a 10-g amio load , and he has remained in normal\nsinus rhythm since that episode. However , after the patient had\nbeen transferred to the floor and was stable , he received a\nsingle lead AICD given his history of dilated cardiomyopathy ,\ncoronary artery disease , and status post VF arrest.\nPulmonary: The patient was initially intubated in the CCU for\nairway protection. He was rapidly weaned on the sedation. He\nwas successfully extubated on 1/28/03 . However , his chest x-ray\nwas complicated by left lower lobe infiltrate , which was\nconcerning for pneumonia. He ultimately has sputum culture that\ngrew out pseudomonas and he has been treated with a 14-day course\nfor pseudomonal pneumonia. Please see ID section below for more\ndetails.\nInfectious Disease: The patient with hypotension and question of\nsepsis , septic physiology on 1/28/03 . He was started on empiric\nlevofloxacin and Flagyl for question aspiration pneumonia by\nchest x-ray. He was also given one dose of gentamicin and then\ncovered his broad into ceftaz , vanc , levo , and Flagyl while\nawaiting results. He ultimately had no growth from any blood\ncultures , although did have on sputum culture positive for\npseudomonas which was sensitive to ceftazidime , but resistant to\nlevofloxacin. He was ultimately switched over to single agent\nceftazidime for a total of 14-day course for pseudomonal\npneumonia/bronchitis.\nRenal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a\nbaseline creatinine of 1.6 and 2.0. In the Intensive Care Unit ,\nhe had a rise of his creatinine up to a peak of 2.8. At the time\nof discharge , he still has slightly elevated creatinine at 2.2 ,\nalthough it seems to be normalizing. It is likely that this is\ncontributed by his Dilaudid received at the time of\ncatheterization.\nHeme: The patient anticoagulated at home with Coumadin and then\nduring his hospitalization with unfractionated heparin for his\nBjork-Shiley valve with a goal PTT of 60 to 80. At the time of\ndischarge , he is being recoumadinized with a goal INR of 2.5 to\n3.5. Previously , his home dose of Coumadin had been 2 mg p.o.\nq.d. He will need to have his heparin dripped to 10 units\ntherapeutically with PTT 60 to 80 until his INR is therapeutic on\nCoumadin. Hematology continued the patient also with a\nmacrocytic anemia , currently on folate therapy. At the time of\ndischarge , his labs were pending for a B12 level , methylmalonic\nacid , and homocysteine did need to be followed up while the\npatient is at rehab.\nEndocrine: The patient with diabetes. He was continued on NPH\nwith a Regular Insulin sliding scale with good control of his\nsugars. At the time of discharge , he should remain on his NPH\nwith sliding scale coverage.",

In 1983 , the patient was admitted to Nocksu Hospital\nwhere she ruled in for a non Q wave myocardial infarction with peak\nCK of 182 , 7% MB. EKG showed global T wave inversions. The\npatient was transferred to Tampnew Hospital where a\ncardiac catheterization was performed which showed an 80% proximal\nLAD lesion and a 30% mid RCA lesion. The patient was then\ntransferred to Rocke Elel Word Hospital for PTCA. The angioplasty\nprocedure was not done. The patient was managed medically and did\nwell for the next seven years from a cardiac standpoint. She had\nonly minimal anginal symptoms and shortness of breath during that\nperiod. In April of 1988 , the patient had an echocardiogram\nwhich showed significant LVH , decreased LV compliance , borderline\nleft atrial enlargement and no regional wall motion abnormalities.\nIn October of 1991 , the patient had an ETT in which she exercised for\nfour minutes , 28 seconds achieving a peak heart rate of 103 and a\npeak blood pressure of 150/60 , stopping secondary to fatigue and\nshortness of breath without chest pain or EKG changes. Also in\nOctober of 1991 , the patient had pulmonary function tests which\nshowed normal spirometry and lung volumes. On 7/28/91 , the patient\nwas having progressive shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion\nthat morning. She presented to Li General Hospital with worsening\ndyspnea , wheezing. Her respiratory rate was 30 , and O2 saturation\nwas 85%. The patient was treated for presumed asthma with\nBronkosol nebulizers and Solu-Medrol. During the second Bronkosol\ntreatment , the patient developed 2/10 substernal chest pressure\nradiating to the left arm which was relieved completely with one\nsublingual nitroglycerin. There were no EKG changes. The patient\nwas transferred to West Hospital where she underwent\na V-Q scan , the results of which showed low probability of\npulmonary embolus. O2 saturation was 95%. The patient was sent\nhome on Ventolin inhaler. The patient stayed at home for the next\nthree weeks , symptom-free. On 7/14 , the patient while walking at\nthe Jose Xingsterka Sno became acutely short of breath with 2/10\nsubsternal chest pressure radiating to the right arm without\nnausea , vomiting or diaphoresis or lightheadedness. The chest\npressure and shortness of breath decreased with rest. The patient\nthen presented to the Adin Hospital and was then transferred to\nDutchessa Hospital .

In the setting of the Bronkosol , the\npatient had substernal chest pressure radiating to the left arm.\nEKG showed 1 mm of ST depression in I and L and 1 mm ST elevation\nin lead III. The pain resolved with three sublingual\nnitroglycerin. The pain recurred a few minutes later and was again\nresolved with Nitropaste and IV Lopressor. The patient ruled out\nfor myocardial infarction with CPK's of 43 , 36 , 37. The patient\nwas then transferred to the Medical Service and was managed with\ndiltiazem , Lopressor , Isordil and aspirin. On hospital day number\ntwo , the patient went for echocardiogram which was not obtained\nbecause the patient had developed 5/10 substernal chest pressure\nwhich resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. There were no\nEKG changes , the patient was started on heparin with question of\nunstable angina at that time. On hospital day number three , the\npatient went for cardiac catheterization which showed serial 40 and\n50% lesions in the LAD and also an 80% lesion in the distal RCA.\nThere were no complications post catheterization. It was\nquestionable whether these lesions were serious enough to account\nfor the patient's symptoms. The patient's medical regimen was\nadvanced and she has tolerated that well and has been symptom free\nfor the past 48 hours. She was discharged home in stable\ncondition. She will follow-up with Dr. Gagne in one week. The\npatient also had asymptomatic pyuria and bacteruria and was treated\nfor a presumed urinary tract infection with three days of oral\nBactrim.",

He was discharged yesterday and now\npresents with fevers , chills , shaking , and increasing abdominal\ndistention. On admission also , noted to have increased sputum\nproduction and therefore question aspiration event was considered\nwhile at rehab. At his recent hospital stay , he was evaluated\nfor PFO , which was found to be negative , had no paroxysmal atrial\nfibrillation , had hypertensive episodes to systolic blood\npressure of 240 , which responded well to hydralazine. Had a\ntroponin leak to peak of 1.94 , which trended down and was\nconsidered to be demand related. At baseline , the patient lives\nwith his wife at home , walks with a walker , and requires\nassistance with ADLs. On arrival on the floor , the patient had a\ntemperature of 101.3 , axillary , heart rate 80s to 90s , blood\npressure 180s/80s , and O2 saturation of 97% on three liters.

Urine culture on 4/5/06 , greater than 100 , 000 pansensitive\nE. coli.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-5": "HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. The patient was found to have a pansensitive E. coli UTI and a\nquestionable left lower lobe pneumonia , which would have likely\nbeen due to aspiration given the patient's recent stroke and\ndocumented aspiration by Speech and Swallow on previous\nadmission. The patient's white count , which was initially 19.8\non the day of admission trended down over the first three days of\nhis admission as he was treated with Levaquin. The Levaquin ,\nwhich will cover both the urinary tract infection and the\npossibility of aspiration pneumonia will be continued for a total\nof a 14-day course to end on 11/16/06. The patient's blood\ncultures showed no growth.\n2. GU , the patient was found to have 1.5 mL of urine in his\nbladder when he was admitted indicating significant urinary\nretention. A Foley was placed and the patient drained the urine.\nThe patient was started on Flomax to improve his recovery from\nthe urethral obstruction. Most likely , the patient has\nunderlying urinary retention that was exacerbated by his recent\nFoley placement during his previous admission. Then when he went\nto rehab without the Foley ( note he did void several times prior\nto discharge from the hospital ). The patient developed urinary\nobstruction likely contributing to his urinary tract infection\nand requiring readmission. The Foley was kept in place until\nhospital day four. When the Foley was taken out , the patient did\nnot void at all. A bladder scan ten hours after the Foley was\ntaken out revealed 432 mL of urine in his bladder. A Foley was\nreplaced in his bladder and Urology was consulted. Urology\nrecommended bladder rest for seven days meaning that the Foley\nshould be left in place for seven days and then he is to follow\nup with Dr. Booker Randgaard with the Foley still in place for a\nvoiding trial within a week after discharge.\n3. Renal , the patient's creatinine at admission was 2.2 , which\nis significantly above his baseline. This was attributed to\nacute renal failure secondary to the urinary obstruction. When\nthe Foley was placed , his creatinine steadily declined , and on\nthe day prior to discharge was 1.2 , which is within his normal\nrange.\n4. Cardiovascular , the patient continued to be hypertensive with\nSBPs greater than 200 , particularly at night. Therefore , during\nhis hospital course , his blood pressure regimen was titrated up\nsuch that at the time of discharge , his blood pressure regimen is\nLopressor 50 q.i.d. and Norvasc 10 daily. Blood pressures during\n24 hours prior to discharge ranged from 110 to 140/70s and his\nheart rate ranged 64 to 82.\n5. Endocrine , the patient was treated with insulin and his p.o.\nregimen while inhouse and this can be continued at rehab. He\nwill be discharged on Lantus 12 , NovoLog sliding scale , and\ntolbutamide 500 daily.\n6. GI , the patient had a steadily rising alk phos through the\ncourse of his hospital stay. At admission , it was 206 and it\nrose to 508. A GGT was drawn and found to also be elevated at\n119 , therefore a right upper quadrant ultrasound was completed ,\nwhich showed a contracted gallbladder with gallstones but no\nacute cholecystitis. The patient was found to be constipated on\nthe day prior to discharge and was given a Dulcolax suppository ,\nwhich had worked in the past.\n7.

In 1992 , a catheterization was performed with\nclean coronary arteries by report. In February of 1994 , he had a\n\"cerebrovascular accident\". He was on Coumadin at that time. His\nsymptoms included right hand and face anesthesia and hemiplegia\nwhich lasted only a few seconds and were self resolved. A CT was\nnegative by report. He was started on Coumadin subsequently. In\nFebruary of 1994 , he had an echocardiogram which demonstrated a\nleft ventricular end diastolic diameter of 6.2 cm and ejection\nfraction of 20%. There was no thrombus seen. There was 2+ mitral\nregurgitation. There were no regional wall motion abnormalities.\nHe was doing fairly well at home with medical management without\nany admissions for congestive heart failure until earlier this\nyear. He began to have worsening symptoms following a viral\nillness in October of 1997. At that time an echocardiogram in\nOctober of 1997 demonstrated a probably left ventricular thrombus\nand ejection fraction of 12%. His Lasix dose was increased and his\nAtenolol dose was decreased. He improved and in October of 1997 , he\nwas able to participate in activities such as sledding and skating\nwith only occasional chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion. In\nOctober of 1997 , an exercise tolerance test was performed which he\nwent 11 minutes. Maximum heart rate was 148. His rate pressure\nproduct was 18 , 000 and the peak oxygen consumption was 20.4. At\nthe time nitrates were added to his regimen. His Atenolol was\nincreased. However , nitrates were discontinued because of headache\nand insomnia. Now , over the prior one to two months , proceeding\nadmission , he has had worsening symptoms with orthopnea , dyspnea on\nminimal exertion with less than one flight of stairs , decreased\nappetite. His weight is stable , but it is felt to be a decrease in\nthe body amount with an increase in fluid weight. He has nocturnal\nshortness of breath and dyspnea. There is no syncope. He was seen\nby Dr. Parker Willy and was felt to be at that time a class four\non the Thyna 1 , Cuse , Nebraska 41604 . His Lasix was increased and he\nwas referred for admission.",

There was an increase in\nleft atrial size since October of 1997 , otherwise no acute changes.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-13": "HOSPITAL COURSE  This is a 42 year-old gentleman with idiopathic\ndilated cardiomyopathy now presented with\nworsening functional status over the past few months as well as\nrecent fluid overload necessitating increase in Lasix. There was a\nquestion of patient non-compliance especially given his current\nalcohol use which raises the question of psychologic readiness for\ncardiac transplant at this time. Following admission , the patient\nunderwent a right heart catheterization which demonstrated right\natrial pressure of 7 , right ventricular pressure of 55/12 , PA\npressures of 58/32 , mean wedge pressure of 30 , arterial pressure at\nthe time was 113/74 with a mean of 90. Additionally , by Fick , his\ncardiac output was 2.85 with a cardiac index of 1.49 , pulmonary\nvenous resistance of 280 and a systemic venous resistance of 2 , 330.\nBecause of this markedly high SVR and a borderline PVR , he was\nstarted on intravenous nitrates with intravenous Nitroprusside with\na significant decrease in his SVR as well as his PA pressures.\nThis was felt to be a significant enough reduction in his pressures\nto suggest that he would be a successful transplant candidate.\nTherefore , he was transitioned to oral nitrates and started on\nIsordil by mouth. However , he developed intolerance to nitrates\nwith severe headaches and ultimately all nitrates were\ndiscontinued. He was subsequently managed only on afterload\nreduction. His Analopril was held and he was started on Captopril\nwhich was titrated up with good maintenance of his decrease in\npressure. Additionally , he was started on Losartan for further\nafterload reduction which he tolerated well without orthostatic\nsymptoms. His Lasix was gradually increased and he continued to\nhave quite a significant improvement symptomatically with no\nfurther orthopnea in the hospital. Further parts of the cardiac\ntransplant work-up were undertaken including PPD and controls which\nwere placed. There was no reaction to either PPDs or controls at\n72 hours. He had a B12 and folate level drawn which were within\nnormal limits. His thyroid function test demonstrated a TSH of 1.9\nand all other parameters were within normal limits. Digoxin level\non discharge was maintained in a therapeutic range. Hepatitis\npanel was sent and he was negative for Hepatitis B antigen or\nantibody as well as Hepatitis C antibodies. 24 hour urine\ncollection was obtained for creatinine and his creatinine clearance\nwas at 88 at 24 hours. Pulmonary function tests were as noted\nabove. He was seen by Dental Consult and was felt to have a few\nminor restorative needs which could be taken care of by his\noutpatient dentist , but he was dentally cleared otherwise for a\ntransplant. Subsequent to his medical changes and his transplant\nwork-up , he was restarted on his Coumadin and was discharged when\nhis INR had become greater than 2 with a target range of 2 to 2.5\nplanned. Echocardiogram was performed on October , 1997 which\ndemonstrated 1+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+ mitral regurgitation ,\nseverely dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 20%.\nThere was diffuse severe hypokinesis and apical akinesis. There\nwas evidence of echo contrast within the left ventricle suggesting\na clot. There was moderate left atrial enlargement.",

Since then it has persisted and\nworsened , and she was seen by a primary care physician. Initial\nendoscopy was performed , which was suspicious for malignancy ,\nhowever , the patient was on Coumadin and no biopsy was obtained\nat that time. She underwent a repeat upper endoscopy on August ,\n2005 at the Arma Healthcare Health The EGD revealed that Ms. Hinrichsen\nhad Barrett's esophagus as well as a nodule on the distal\nesophagus. No evidence of gastritis. A biopsy of the nodule\nrevealed poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma at 35 cm.\nIt appeared to be rising in association with Barrett's\nesophagitis. She also has a history of ischemic myopathy with an\nLVEF of approximately 20% and CAD with a history of bypass graft\nin 1992 and a biventricular ICD placed in October 2004. She\nunderwent an endoscopy on September , 2005 , an EUS revealed that she\nhad an intramural lesion in the distal esophagus measuring 2 cm\nin diameter invading into the muscularis propria , therefore she\nwas staged and having T3 , N0 , MX , and tumor by EUS. She was seen\nat Toards Health in mid July by both Dr. Tyrell Aningalan\nfrom Medial Oncology and Dr. Wahlen from Radiation Oncology. It was\nfelt that she was a reasonable candidate for consideration of\nchemoradiation. She therefore began her chemoradiation and\nradiotherapy , chemotherapy including Taxol and cisplatin.\nApproximately 1 week prior to admission on February , 2005 ,\nunfortunately , she reports over the course of the past week , she\nhas had increasing dysphagia to the point where she is having\ntrouble swallowing liquids. She presented for her routine\nradiation therapy the day prior to admission , with complaints of\nsevere lightheadedness and difficulty getting off the radiation\ntable. She was taken to the ED , where she was found to be\ndehydrated and weak. She had some chills , but no fever , no\nhemoptysis or diarrhea.

Full code.",
        "BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE-21": "BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. Lightheadedness: It was felt that all of her lightheadedness\nwas most likely due to dehydration. Her lightheadedness improved\nwith hydration , it was most likely due to poor p.o. intake.\nNutrition evaluated her and suggested high calorie supplements ,\nhowever , she continued to be nauseated and unable to take good\np.o. GI was consulted regarding possible stenting of her\nesophagus given that she had an intra-esophageal lesion that\ncould potentially be causing this nausea. She was also ordered\nfor a barium swallow. On the barium swallow , there was a strict\nstenotic lesion of the esophagus , which is not allowed any food\nto pass through. An EGD was performed , which showed some food\nabout a tight stenosis that was unable to be passed. Based upon\nthis it was felt that she would benefit from a G-tube.\nInterventional radiology was consulted and placed a G-tube\nwithout complication. Tube feeds were begun and she tolerated\nthem well without complication. She has been continued on tube\nfeeds and is currently at goal of 360 cc four times a day , with a\nscoop of promod , these will be continued upon discharge.\n2. TIA/CVA: On the evening of 5/24/05 , it was noted that she\nhad decreased ability to move the left side of her body. Based\nupon this , a STAT CT and CTA was performed. The CT showed no\nbleeding , and during the CT scan , she regained all function in\nthe left side , however , the CTA did note a large friable clot\nwithin her right ICA. Based upon her high level of heart disease\nand high risk for an operative procedure , it was not felt that\nshe would be a stent candidate at that time. She was continued\non Lovenox therapy with Coumadin with the plan to discharge her\non medical management for this TIA. However , on the morning of\n8/16/05 , she was noted to have a new left-sided facial droop.\nShe also had some left-sided weakness. A STAT CT , CTA once again\nshowed no bleed. At this point , the clot was noted to have moved\nfrom the right ICA into the MCA , and to have dissolved somewhat.\nBased upon this , it felt that she would have good recovery from\nher stroke , and she was not a candidate for any sort of\nintervention at that time. She was converted over to heparin\ndrip with the plan to give her a heparin drip as bridging over\nwhile her Coumadin became therapeutic. She was continued on\nheparin drip until her INR was therapeutic. She will be\ndischarged on Coumadin and continued on Coumadin and aspirin\ntherapy for life.\n3. Esophageal Cancer: She was continued on XRT for the entire\ntime when she was in the hospital. Conversations between Dr.\nDepaoli , Dr. Serl and the family were had and it was felt that she\nwas no longer a chemotherapy candidate given her poor status , in\nterms of her other issues. She will be continued on XRT after\ndischarge from the hospital.\n4. Acute Renal Failure: On admission , she was noted to have an\nincreased creatinine; it was felt to be most likely due to\ndehydration. However , at the time of admission , she had a BUN of\n50% and a renal ultrasound was performed , the renal ultrasound\nwas normal and showed no further defect over the course of her\nhospital stay. Her creatinine continued trending down and was\n0.9 on the day prior to discharge.\n5. CAD: She has a history of CHF with an EF of 50%. She was\nmonitored on tele for arrhythmia and no arrhythmia was observed.\nShe does of note have a right bundle branch block at baseline as\nwell as biventricular pacer with 1 lead out of place causing a\nwide complex rhythm. There were multiple alarms for VT , which\nwere simply her baseline rhythm. In the hospital , she was\ncontinued on digoxin , Lopressor , and Imdur. Her Lasix was\ninitially held , while she was being hydrated , however , it was\nrestarted after the G-tube was placed and she was getting\nsufficient feeds. She was also continued on her statin. She had\nno other cardiac issues while she was in the hospital.\n6. Nausea: She was treated with Zofran for her nausea when she\nwas admitted and she continued to have good response to this.\n7. Urinary Tract Infection: On the 25 of May she noted that she was\nhaving increasing pain on urination and increasing burning , an UA\nwas done and it was found to be positive for infection. A\nculture was performed , which showed enterobacter that was\nlevo-sensitive. She was started on Levaquin and the Foley , which\nhad been placed prior was discontinued. She was continued on\nLevaquin for a 10-day course and this will be continued for\nseveral days after discharge.\n8. Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her Synthroid at her\nhome dosages while she was in-house.\n9. GERD: She was continued on Prevacid while she was in-house.\n10. A-fib: She was continued on Coumadin , although it was held\nprior to her EGD and G-tube placement. During the time when she\nwas not therapeutic on her Coumadin she was treated with either\nLovenox subcu. or heparin IV drip titrated to a PTT of 60 to 80 ,\ntherefore she was always therapeutic on her anticoagulin during\nthis hospital stay.\n11. She was initially on a full diet , however , she was unable to\ntake any p.o. so she was started on tube feeds , which she was\nable to make her goal. Nutrition was involved in her care and\nshe was continued on multivitamin.\n12. She was on Lovenox or heparin drip throughout her\nhospitalization for DVT prophylaxis. She was also continued on\nPrevacid.",

He had prior a\northopaedic workup that was negative. He is receiving oxycodone.\nThere has been some thought that maybe his hypomagnesemia is\nexacerbating his pain possibly in the form of leg cramps. He is\nbeing repleted with mag with increasing doses of standing\nmagnesium. However , exam is most consistent with underlying diabetic\nneuropathy and he was started on Neurontin 300 qhs , which will need to be\ntitrated as outpatient.\nDiabetes: He is a diabetic on oral agents. His oral medications\nwere held while in house and he was given NPH and sliding scale. Oral\nmedications were reinstituted for the last 5 days of his hospitalization.\nAnticoagulation: He has history of antiphospholipid antibody\nwith history of stroke from mitral clot. He was supratherapeutic\non his Coumadin , upon arrival he was reversed with vitamin K and\nis now subtherapeutic being bridged with Lovenox until his\nCoumadin is at least 2. His Coumadin should be titrated\naccording to INRs that are checked every other day until for a\ngoal of INR 2-3.\nPsychiatric: For his bipolar disorder and seizure disorder , he\nwas continued on his home meds.\nNeurological: He had a brief episode of delirium over the\nweekend which was likely thought to be metabolic and has now\nresolved. He is at his baseline. He should avoid opiates when\npossible.\nDisposition: He was discharged to home on new medications which\ninclude increased magnesium , flomax , neurontin.

Zetia was stopped and\nshe was started on Pravachol 20 mg QHS.\nHer back pain is relieved by leaning forward and she walks at Arkansas\nwith a shopping cart for exercise which is consistent with spinal stenosis.\nThey recommended physical therapy and MRI imaging of her back. The MRI\npreliminary read shows multilevel degenerative disc disease and moderate\nspinal stenosis at one level. Physical therapy saw her and thought she\nwould benefit from home PT in the future--she was given a prescription for\noutpatient physical therapy.\nSince she is on long term prednisone she should have a DEXA scan and may\nbenefit from bisphosphonate therapy.\nDischarge Medication: Cellcept 1000 mg BID , Lantus 20 SC QAM , Nabumetone 500\nmg PO BID , Pravachol 20 mg PO QHS , Glyburide 10 mg PO QAM , Cyclosporine 75\nmg PO BID , Toprol 50 mg PO QDay , Prednisone 6 mg PO QAM , Plavix 75 PO QDay ,\nZantac 150 mg BID , Furosemide 40 mg PO QDay , Fe 325 PO TID , ECASA 325 PO\nQDay",

His\ncultures here at the Tholond Crawni Hospital remain negative. They removed his\ninfected pacemaker , as well as his Hickman catheter. He has been\nafebrile here for the last several weeks , 2-3 weeks prior to\ndischarge.\n2. Cardiovascular - ( A ) Rhythm - His pacemaker was removed. It\nhad been interrogated not long prior to his admission here and had\nnot been firing , and therefore , did not appear to be needed anyway.\nHe had to return to the EP lab a second time for a lead extraction ,\nas they were unable to pull out the leads on the first attempt. By\nhis repeat echoes , however , he appears to have a retained pacemaker\nwire although EP believes that they removed the entire wire for all\nintents and purposes. It should be assumed that he does have a\nretained wire , however. Also , the patient had episodes of atrial\nflutter with rapid ventricular response and a decreased blood\npressure after his pacemaker was removed. He was ultimately\ntreated with amiodarone with excellent control over his weight and\nrhythm , and has been in normal sinus rhythm for the last week or so\nprior to discharge. There are no plans for pacemaker placement at\nthis time. ( B ) Ischemia - He complained of chest pain while he was\nhere and ruled out for a MI. ( C ) Pump - Hypertensive while in\natrial flutter and then again during an episode of acute blood\nloss. Since both issues have resolved , his blood pressures have\nbeen very stable. He is to be continued on his Vasotec and\nLopressor. ( D ) Vascular - He had a traumatic left groin line\nattempt. Vascular , subsequently , performed a groin exploration ,\nhematoma evacuation , and sutured his vascular laceration. The\npatient continued to lose a significant amount of blood into his\nthigh , requiring several units of blood and one unit of platelets.\nHis hematocrit , however , has now been stable for one week prior to\ndischarge. He has a follow-up appointment with vascular on\n11/20/03.\n3. FEN/GU - Hemodialysis patent , very poor access. After removal\nof his possibly infected hemodialysis catheter , IR was completely\nunable to place an IJ or subclavian catheter on either side.\nUltimately , they had to place a tunnelled right groin line which is\nvery poor long-term option. He has a followup in vascular clinic with Dr Granfield\non 11/10/03 to address his access issue , for possible creatine of a groin\nAVfistula or graft.\n4. Heme - Hematocrit now stable , high 20s , low 30s. B12 and\nfolate are normal.\n5. Disposition - The patient is to be discharged to rehab on\n10/11/03 in stable condition. He has become very deconditioned\nwhile he was here in the hospital as he was unable to get much PT\nhere given both his groin hematoma and some of his groin access\nissues. Now there are no restrictions on his activity as his right\ngroin line is tunnelled.",

No aspirin was given , as the patient is on\nCoumadin and has a history of guaiac-positive stool.\nb. Pump: The patient was dry on admission in the setting of\nnausea , vomiting , and decreased p.o. intake. Her last echo\nshowed an EF of 55% presumed diastolic dysfunction ,\nmild-to-moderate MR as well as pulmonary hypertension of unclear\netiology ( pulmonary artery pressure was 64 mmHg plus right atrial\npressure ). Initially , the patient's ethacrynic acid was held\ngiven dehydration , but was restarted towards the end of her\nadmission and titrated out to b.i.d. dosing to maintain a\nslightly negative fluid balance. The patient was also continued\non her beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor after she was adequately\nhydrated for blood pressure control.\nc. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial\nfibrillation. She has a pacer placed and is V-paced. She is on\nCoumadin with her INR at goal.\n2. Pulmonary: The admission chest x-ray was read as a streaky\nopacity of the right lung base possibly representing an\ninfiltrate , but curve has been artifact due to low lung volume.\nThe patient had no clinical evidence of pneumonia ( no cough , lung\nexam clear ).\n3. GI: The patient had nausea , vomiting for several days prior\nto admission with decreased p.o. intake. She also reported no\nbowel movement in the last weeks prior to admission. A KUB was\nobtained on admission , which showed no evidence of obstruction or\nfree air. The patient was given stool softeners and laxatives\np.r.n. and began to have her regular bowel movements. She was\ncontinued on Nexium for her history of gastroesophageal reflux\ndisease. The patient's nausea and vomiting improved overall\nthroughout her admission , however , intermittently returned.\nThere is no clear cause for this nausea and vomiting , but it was\nthought likely to be a contribution of her opioid medications ,\nwhich were increased early on in her hospitalization to address\nher postherpetic neuralgia. The patient's nausea improved with\nReglan. Nausea , vomiting was improved on the day of discharge.\nThe patient had significantly better p.o. intake. The patient\nalso complained of dysphagia for two months prior to admission ,\nthis occurred mainly with solid foods. Per Speech and Swallow ,\nthe patient was initially on a soft mechanical/thin liquid diet\nand is concerned for an obstructive lesion. A video swallow was\nobtained on 3/4/05. This study showed no aspiration and normal\npassage of fluid of varying consistencies ( although a note was\nmade of cricopharyngeal prominence ). Speech and Swallow\nrecommended a minced solid/thin liquid diet , which the patient\nhas tolerated well. The patient has a history of an elevated\nalkaline phosphatase ( with elevated GGT ) of unclear etiology.\nAbdominal ultrasound on her last admission in October 2005\nshowed gallstones , but no other process to explain the\nabnormalities in alkaline phosphatase. The patient had no right\nupper quadrant pain on this admission.\n4. Renal/FEN: The patient was initially given intravenous\nfluids for dehydration. She was also found to have a urinary\ntract infection and was initially started on levofloxacin\nempirically. The urine culture returned was Staph aureus ( the\npatient has had indwelling Foley ) and the patient was switched to\ndoxycycline ( the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs , penicillin ,\nand erythromycin ). Blood cultures were negative. The patient\nhas been afebrile through this admission. She was also noted to\nhave a urinary retention on a few occasions where an attempt was\nmade to remove her Foley catheter. This was thought most likely\ndue to urinary tract infection and to use opioid medications.\nThe patient will be discharged to rehab with her Foley in place\nand is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Urology on\nOctober , 2005.\n5. Neuro: The patient has postherpetic neuralgia affecting her\nright face/ear. She was admitted on OxyContin and oxycodone ,\nwhich was titrated out in an attempt to make her more comfortable\nand Neurontin was also titrated out with good effect on her pain.\nGiven her nausea and urinary retention , the patient's opioid\nmedications were decreased. A trial of a lidoderm patch on the\naffected area was attempted prior to discharge.\n6. Heme: The patient's INR was at goal ( 2 to 3 ) on Coumadin for\nher history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\n7. Prophylaxis: The patient was on Nexium and Coumadin.\n8. Code status: DNR/DNI.\n9. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to a\nrehabilitation facility. She will follow up with her primary\ncare doctor Dr. Eddie Nitterhouse In addition , an appointment has\nbeen made for her to see Dr. Nang on January , 2005 at 9:30\na.m. In addition , an appointment has been made with Dr. Storch\nin Neurology on October , 2005 at 11:15 a.m. and it is requested\nthat the patient's basic metabolic panel be monitored while she\nis on ethacrynic acid. In addition , her weight should be\nfollowed daily to check for fluid accumulation. She will also\nbenefit from physical therapy as she is deconditioned. The\npatient is stable at the time of this dictation.\nThe discharge medications will be dictated in an addendum to this\ndischarge summary.\neScription document: 5-4891603 ISSten Tel",

        "ASSESSMENT-14": "ASSESSMENT \nOn assessment , this is a 73-year-old gentleman recently\ndischarged for minor COPD flare , presenting with acute hypoxemia\nlikely secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia with COPD.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM-15": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM \n1. Pulmonary:\na. Hypoxia: The patient presented with acute and chronic\nhypoxia. The patient initially required short term MICU stay for\na BiPAP and was gradually weaned to facemask over 24 hours. On\nday two of admission , he was weaned to 8 liters and was\ntransferred to the floor where his respiratory management was\ncontinued. On 10/4/05 , day 3 of hospitalization , the patient\nhad been weaned to 5 liters when he began coughing and abruptly\ndesaturated to 70% oxygen saturation with complaints of shortness\nof breath and chest pain and required nonrebreather. The patient\nhad no EKG changes and a chest x-ray was unchanged from prior on\n9/30/05 .  The patient was given DuoNeb and chest PT. He was\nstabilized and was able to be managed on the floor and\ntransitioned back to 8 liters. At time of discharge , he has been\nweaned to 4 liters with 91-97% oxygen saturation. The patient\ndoes continue to desaturate with activities and requires further\npulmonary rehabilitation including chest PT to remove mucus\nplugging noted on CT PE from earlier hospitalization in April .\nb. Pneumonia: The patient presented with left lower lobe\npneumonia. He was started on vancomycin , ceftriaxone , and\nazithromycin on 9/30/05 .  He had a sputum culture positive for\nMRSA and was therefore continued on vancomycin. He was briefly\ntransitioned to vancomycin with ceftazidime and Flagyl from\n8/14/05 to 08 , but was switched back to vancomycin with\ncefotaxime and azithromycin on 5/26/05 .  On day of discharge , he\nwill be leaving on vancomycin to complete two more days of\ntreatment for a total 10-day course. In addition , he will be\ndischarged on Levaquin for an additional seven-day course of\ntreatment for his pneumonia.\nc. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and was\nmost recently discharged on 5/10/05 for mild COPD exacerbation\ntreated with DuoNeb and steroid taper. During this hospital\ncourse , the patient continued on DuoNeb treatments as well as a\nsteroid taper. Given his acute clinical course in this\nhospitalization , the patient did not have pulmonary function test\nperformed but with benefit from PFT studies as an outpatient. At\ntime of discharge , the patient is on 4 liters of oxygen and is\ncurrently on prednisone 5 mg which will be tapered to his home\nregimen of prednisone 5 mg every other day.\nd. Hypertension: The patient had been noted to have a pulmonary\nartery pressure in 2003 in the 60s but on this admission had an\necho at time of admission that noted that his pulmonary artery\npressure was now at 98 mmHg. The patient was followed by the\nInsmotho Erout Hospital Service to assess his pulmonary hypertension.\nThe patient will be followed as an outpatient by the\nMalv Medical Center Service and will likely need right heart\ncatheterization to assess his right heart function as well as his\npulmonary hypertension.\n2. Cardiovascular:\na. Pump: The patient has congestive heart failure with\ndiastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction around 60% as\nnoted on an echo done on 9/30/05 .  The patient initially had his\nLasix held due to his creatinine of 1.7 at time of admission.\nHowever , given his acute respiratory status , as well as his\nincreasing edema during his hospital course , the patient was\nagain aggressively diuresed for his CHF exacerbation with Lasix.\nAt time of discharge , the patient still has trace edema and his\ncreatinine has remained at his baseline of 1.1-1.2. The patient\nwill be discharged on his home Lasix regimen of 40 mg p.o.\nalthough he required IV Lasix on multiple occasions during his\nhospital course.\nb. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension.\nOverall , his systolic blood pressure remained in the range from\n110-130s. The patient was on Lopressor during his hospital\ncourse and had no acute issues regarding his hypertension.\nc. Ischemia: The patient had been ruled out for MI with three\nsets of negative cardiac biomarkers. He was continued on\ntelemetry and remained on a regimen of aspirin , beta blockers , as\nwell as statin during this hospital course.\nd. Rate: The patient has a history of arrhythmias with\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation and SVTs. At last admission on\n10/10/05 , the patient presented to the ED in SVT and hypotensive\nand reverted back to normal sinus rhythm after one dose of IV\nLopressor. The patient was continued on Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d.\nduring his hospital course with his DuoNeb treatments. The\npatient did occasionally have heart rate into the 140s consistent\nwith AV nodal reentry tachycardia. These incidences did not last\nmore than 2 minutes and the patient was in general asymptomatic\nfrom these arrhythmias although did occasionally did complain of\nsome shortness of breath on occasion during these periods of\narrhythmia. The patient is being continued on Lopressor 50 mg\nt.i.d.\n3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetes\nthat was under diet control as an outpatient with steroid\ntreatment for his COPD exacerbation. The patient did have his\nblood glucose measured regularly three times a day and required a\nregular insulin sliding scale for his steroid-induced diabetes.\nWith tapering of the steroids , the patient's blood glucose has\ngenerally ranged between 100-150 and has required less insulin.\nWhile the patient is on steroids , we will continue to monitor his\nblood glucose level and cover with insulin as needed. The\npatient will follow up with his primary care physician and\ndiscuss further his overall need for oral hypoglycemic agents.\n4. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal\ninsufficiency with baseline creatinine around 1.1-1.2. At\ninitial time of presentation , his creatinine was 1.7 and his\nLasix had been held. However , the patient developed lower\nextremity edema with shortness of breath and required Lasix for\nhis CHF exacerbation. His creatinine was followed closely during\nhis hospital course and with Lasix diureses his creatinine did\nrise slowly to 1.4 , however , the benefits of diureses for CHF\nexacerbation outweighed his chronic renal insufficiency state.\nWe would recommend that the patient follow up with his primary\ncare physician to monitor his renal state.\n5. FEN: During this hospital course , the patient's electrolytes\nwere monitored and repleted as needed. He had no acute issues\nregarding his electrolytes or nutritional status. However , the\npatient should continue on low-salt 2 g sodium diet as well as\nlimit his fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day.\n6. ID: The patient , at initial time of admission , had a\ntemperature of 101.2 with white cell count as high as 16. He was\nfound on chest x-ray to have a left lower lobe pneumonia and was\nstarted on a antibiotic course as dictated above in pulmonary.\nThe patient remained afebrile through the extent of this hospital\ncourse while on the antibiotic therapy his sputum cultures were\npositive for MRSA. At time of discharge , he will be continued on\nhis antibiotics on vancomycin for an additional two days for a\ntotal of 10-day course and he will also be started on Levaquin\nfor a seven-day course. At time of discharge , the patient\nremained afebrile with his white cell count of 12.6. The patient\nis on prednisone , which can slightly his overall white cell\ncount. The patient is aware that if he had worsening of his\nsputum production as well as fevers , to seek medical attention.\n7. Heme: The patient had no active issues.\n8. GI: The patient had regular bowel movements during his\nhospital course and deferred bowel regimen. He was on proton\npump inhibitor for prophylaxis and would be continued on this as\nan outpatient.",

The patient denied\nheadaches , visual changes , and epigastric pain. She did report a\n16-pound weight gain over the past two weeks and she had 4+\nprotein on urine dip in the clinic that day. The patient is\ntreated with insulin for her class B diabetes mellitus during\npregnancy. The patient's prenatal screens are notable for Rh\npositive , antibody negative , RPR nonreactive , Gonorrhea and\nChlamydia negative , hemoglobin electrophoresis AA , hepatitis B\nsurface antigen negative , TSH was 2.02 , hemoglobin A1C on\n9/28/2002 was 8.7 , on 3/2/2002 was 9.4 and a chorionic villus\nsampling procedure revealing normal chromosomes. As stated\nabove , the patient is dated by a 7-week ultrasound. Her current\npregnancy has been followed by Dr. Shelton Reges in the Diabetes\nClinic from 8 weeks of gestation. Her prenatal course is notable\nfor a history of chronic hypertension. Her blood pressure was\n122/70 , range of blood pressures during pregnancy was 100/60 to\n130/80. The patient did not require medications during this\npregnancy for blood pressure control. Today in clinic , the\npatient had a blood pressure of 158/90 with 4+ protein on dip.\nShe denied signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. The patient's\nsecond prenatal issue is a history of class B type2 diabetes\nmellitus , on insulin. Her most recent hemoglobin A1C was 6.6 on\n2/2/2003 . The patient's baseline 24-hour urine protein was 59\nmg. The patient had good fetal growth on ultrasound.

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted to Labor and Delivery\nfor rule out preeclampsia. Her initial laboratory studies\nrevealed a creatinine of 0.8 , platelets of 323 , ALT 39 , AST 30 ,\nuric acid 5.6 , 24-hour urine protein was 2 , 995 mg. The patient\nwas managed on the labor floor , ruling in for preeclampsia. She\nwas started on magnesium sulfate therapy for seizure prophylaxis\nand she was begun on betamethasone treatment for fetal lung\nmaturity. Her glucose levels were watched carefully after the\nadministration of betamethasone. She remained stable. After the\npatient was betamethasone complete on 1/24/2003 , an induction of\nlabor was started using cervical ripening agents. The patient\nreceived Cervidil x 1 , Cytotec x 4 , Foley bulb mechanical\ndilatation and low dose Pitocin. After this , she reached 1 cm\ndilatation , 25% effacement , -3 station. At this point on\n5/2/2003 , due to the failure of initiating labor with cervical\nripening agents and Foley bulb , a decision was made to proceed\nwith laminaria to mechanically dilate the cervix further. On\n5/2/2003 , 28 laminaria were placed in the patient's cervix and\nthe patient was restarted on Pitocin. The laminaria were\ndiscontinued and the patient was examined and found to be 3-4 cm ,\n50% with a high station. She was continued on Pitocin for\nprotocol and her cervix did not change. Therefore , the patient\nwas consented for cesarean section for failure to progress with\ninduction of labor and severe preeclampsia. The patient had\nremained stable in regards to her preeclampsia with stable blood\npressures. On 3/25/2003 , the patient underwent a primary\ncesarean section , low transverse for delivery of a 3 pound 7\nounce vigorous infant at 4:35 a.m. , 3/25/2003 . Apgars were 7 at\n1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes respectively. The patient tolerated\nthe procedure well. A JP drain was placed in the subcutaneous\ntissue due to the patient's morbid obesity. The patient's\npostpartum course was notable for restarting the patient on oral\nantihypertensives and continuing to monitor her fingerstick blood\nglucose levels. The patient was started on hydrochlorothiazide\nand lisinopril , which she had been taking prior to pregnancy.\nHer fingersticks were checked and she was covered with a Humalog\nsliding scale. She was on subcutaneous heparin for DVT\nprophylaxis. The patient's Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued\nprior to her discharge and staples were to remain in place for 10\ndays. The patient was discharged to home with Visiting Nurse\nServices to monitor her blood pressure and her fingersticks. The\npatient was to followup with Dr. Spencer Jensrud for further\nmanagement of her diabetes and hypertension.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-6": "HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. Ischemia: The patient presented again with a non-ST\nelevation MI with elevated troponin. The patient had had a\nnegative catheterization just two years ago and it was unclear\nwhether or not her troponin leak was from epicardial coronary\nartery disease or from another source such as pericarditis or\nerosion from endocarditis into her myocardium. Also , given the\nback pain , there was a concern for aortic dissection and a chest\nCT was done on 8/4/04 which showed no aortic dissection. She\nwas continued on heparin , Plavix , aspirin , and beta-blocker and\nwill be restarted on her ACE inhibitor , was not restarted in\nhospital , by her PCP. Given her continued neck pain with endemic\nST changes which included depressions in V2 through V5 , and her\nsubstantial elevation in her troponin I to a peak of 64 , a\ncatheterization was done that demonstrated thrombosis on OM2 at\nthe ostia which was thought to be embolic. All her other\ncoronary arteries appeared normal , so this 100% lesion was\nangioplastied to 50% residual. Post procedure course was\ncomplicated by pulmonary edema with rising O2 requirement. She\ndiuresed well with improvement to room air , satting 100%. She\nagain had neck pain in V2 through V5 depressions on 6/17 , just\nthree days after the catheterization on 3/25 This was\nmedically managed because the dynamic changes did not return and\nthought to be left over plaque from the last lesion. The patient\nhad been stable for about one week before discharge without any\ncomplaints of neck pain whatsoever and her troponins had trended\ndown significantly during this event. The patient had not\ncomplained of any symptoms while walking.\nPump-wise , her echo showed an EF of 60% with preserved LV and RV\nfunction. Her old RVSP increased roughly to 65 , possible\nincrease in mitral gradient. The patient had had RVSP before and\nit had been increased at roughly to 55 mmHg. Possible increase\nin mitral gradient and no veg on her echo though it was tough to\nevaluate given her artificial valve. The patient then had a TEE\nwhich was negative for vegetation or thrombus. It was thought\nthat the thrombus she had already thrown to her OM2 would most\nlikely be the thrombus that she had had and there was none left\non the valves. For that reason , patient was volume overloaded\nand was diuresed on torsemide 100 PO b.i.d. which seems to be a\ngood regimen for her as far as her dry weights seem to be around\n50 kilos , maybe even 48 kilos , and she should have daily weights\nchecked.\nRhythm-wise , the patient had A. fib. She was on tele and no\nevents and she is being anticoagulated both for her valve and for\nher A. fib.\nID-wise , she had increased white blood cell count and a left\nshift with one band , the right lower lobe infiltrate and\ncompleted a 7-day course of levo. Was afebrile throughout the\nhospitalization and had negative blood cultures , and again the\nnegative TEE.\nHeme-wise , her INR goal is now 3 to 4 , ideally 3 to 3.5 , and this\nis essential. Patient will follow up with the Coumadin Clinic.\nHer INR was 5.3 on 1/4/04. She was treated on 3/25/04. She\nhad an INR of ??__?? She is to be drawn by the VNA the next day ,\n11/4/04 , and they should call Coumadin Clinic with the result.\nGiven high INR , we held the Coumadin on 10/20 and restarted dose\non 6/26 at a dose of 3 q.p.m.\nRespiratory-wise , the patient finished levo for presumed\npneumonia and had no other respiratory problems. She did\ncomplain sometimes of subjective shortness of breath , but her\noxygen saturation remained at 100% throughout the rest of the\nhospitalization besides after the cath.\nGI-wise , she is stable. She got some simethicone for gas and a\nbowel regimen. She was doing well , but given her continued pain ,\nGI and surgery consulted on her for a question of mesenteric\nischemia. A CT angiogram of the abdomen was performed with\nnegative workup for mesenteric ischemia. They thought that most\nof her discomfort was due to constipation.\nFEN-wise , we replaced her lytes. Also we put her on carnitine\nfor diet supplementation.\nRenal-wise , the patient had increase in creatinine secondary to\nthe dye load from the cath and both her CT scans. The creatinine\nwas .9 on day of discharge. We held off on starting the ACE\nbecause of this , but she should consider getting an ACE to add to\nher regimen given her diabetes and recent MI. That should be\nstarted as an outpatient.\nEndocrine-wise , her diabetes is in really poor control. She had\nsugars ranging from 40 to 400. We changed her regimen to Lantus\n26 units q.p.m. along with novalog pre-meal with 16 before\nbreakfast and 8 of novalog before lunch and 8 of novalog before\ndinner. Her sugars improved greatly , all in the 100s. She had\nsevere osteoporosis as well and vitamin C deficiency.

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive\nCare Unit for further treatment evaluation of his\nsevere metabolic abnormalities. He also by labs he had a\nsignificant severe pancreatitis and was felt to be either a DKA or\nHHNKA. An endocrine consult was obtained and they felt that the\npatient was likely not in DKA as the patient's level of\nbetahydroxybutyrate of 1.66 was not enought to explain the\npatient's gap or all his metabolic disturbances. The endocrine\nservice that more likely the patient had hyperglycemic ,\nhyperosmolar , nonketotic acidosis and also severe pancreatitis.\nInitial screens for the cause of pancreatitis were negative\nincluding stones. The patient has significant alcohol history and\nhas been drinking alcohol which is the most likely cause of his\nsevere pancreatic insufficiency. The patient was aggressively\nhydrated with IV fluids and his metabolic abnormalities began to\ncorrect. He was also noted by labs to be in acute renal failure\nand a renal consult was obtained. The patient's nonoliguric renal\nfailure was in the setting of severe dehydration secondary to\nhyperosmolar state and ACE inhibitors were felt most likely due to\nATN. A renal ultrasound performed on 1 of July showed no evidence of\ngallstones or biliary duct dilatation.\nAn abdominal CT performed on 7 of July showed grade I pancreatitis with\nno evidence of a pseudocyst. The patient's clinical course was\ncomplicated by rhabdomyolysis which was felt to be due to a\nhypophosphatemic state , but this was not completely clear as the\npatient's CKs began to rise while the patient's phosphate was still\nsecondary to the acute renal failure. The patient's CKs peaked\naround 10 , 000 and then began to fall steadily and the patient's\nrenal function with continued hydration improved steadily as his\ncreatinine and BUN returned to normal. However , in the night of\n20 of June the patient's abdominal pain worsened and there was a\nquestion of peritoneal signs which prompted an emergent exploratory\nlaparotomy to rule out abdominal ischemia. However , the findings\nwere not consistent with ischemic bowel , but only severe\npancreatitis was noted. On 25 of July and 20 of June the patient did very well\npostoperatively back in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. He was\nstarted on TPN and with a slow wean of his of dextrose , his blood\nsugars normalized. On 20 of June the patient's renal function had also\nnormalized. The patient by 5 of September had marked decreased abdominal\npain , normalized electrolytes and his renal function was at his\nbaseline with a creatinine of 1.0.\nThe patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nto our service on 8 of May on TPN and the following medications:\n1. Digoxin 0.375 mg q.d.\n2. Carafate one gram b.i.d.\n3. Albuterol two puffs t.i.d.\n4. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.\nHe is also on TPN , but was being advanced to a clear liquid diet\nand seemed to be tolerating it well. He also continued to require\na large amount of insulin through his TPN and also through his\nsliding scale. The patient did well and was able to tolerate a\nclear liquid diet and was advanced in the next two days to a soft ,\nsolid diet with very low fat.\nI will dictate the rest of the patient's events , assessment and\nplan by problem list as follows:\n1. GI:\nI. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient was able to be advanced\nto a soft solid diet for the past few days. She has abdominal pain\nwhich had almost resolved and then resumed and the patient\ndeveloped a watery diarrhea. It was felt that this could be due to\npancreatic insufficiency versus C. diff colitis and therefore C.\ndiff samples were sent and the patient was presumptively started on\nFlagyl and Pancrease 12 , 000 units t.i.d. 1/2 hour before meals.\nThe patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea persisted. This prompted\nus to make the patient n.p.o. once more and another abdominal CT\nwas obtained. An abdominal CT performed on 30 of March showed\nprogression of pancreatitis with increase inflammatory changes.\nThere was no necrosis or pseudocyst formation noted. Also noted\nwas some significant small bowel dilatation without any evidence of\nobstruction. Therefore , the patient was continued to be kept\nn.p.o. and TPN was restarted on 25 of April .  The patient has tolerated\nthis well and at this time has no longer had any abdominal pain\neither subjectively or on exam. It does occasionally have mild low\nback pain which is thought to actually be due to his pancreatitis\nas opposed to any musculoskeletal cause.\nII. DIARRHEA: The patient also had diarrhea as noted above.\nHe has been worked up extensively. His diarrhea has now resolved.\nHe was C. diff negative , but was treated presumptively with Flagyl\nfor seven days. All stool studies including Shigella , Salmonella ,\nCampylobacter , ova and parasites , Microsporidia have been negative.\nHis stool has been sent for quantitative fecal fast which is still\npending on discharge. He has been repeatedly guaiac negative. As\nnoted above his diarrhea has resolved.\nIII. RESOLVED HEME POSITIVITY: The patient earlier in the\ncourse of his Intensive Care Unit stay had some stools that were\nheme positive. They were thought to be due to gastritis. He has\nnow been on initially , after that has been on Prilosec and now\nchanged over to ranitidine in his TPN and has had multiple guaiac\nnegative stools in the past ten days.\nIV. SMALL PERIANAL ULCER: The patient was noted to have a\nsmall perianal ulcer. It is felt to be secondary to pressure from\nlying in bed and also secondary to his multiple episodes of\ndiarrhea which had been going on for days. It is felt that this\nshould resolve. If it does not , it is suggested that the ulcer be\nswabbed and sent for HSV.\n2. ENDOCRINE:\nI. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS: Due to the patient's\npancreatic insufficiency , the patient will be a life long diabetic.\nThe patient has been followed by the endocrine service and is now\nreceiving 45 units of insulin per liter through his TPN. He is\nalso on a sliding scale regular regimen with finger stick q6h. It\nis felt that this should be a relatively stable regimen for him at\nthis time. As the patient is weaned off his TPN and starts to take\np.o. again , he should be switched over to NPH b.i.d. with regular\ninsulin checks on a sliding scale before his meals. The patient\nalso has a follow-up appointment with the diabetes clinic in three\nweeks as noted below.\n3. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient does have a history of congestive\nheart failure and has had mild bi-basilar crackles throughout his\nstay here. This has not limited him in any way. He has had a good\noxygen saturations. The patient continues to take 40 mg of Lasix\np.o. q.d. On the day of discharge , he received an extra 20 mg IV\nas he has been I&Os positive for the last few days and we noted a\nslightly more crackles on his exam. Of note , the patient has a\nlong history of having paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but had been\ndoing relatively well here. His current medical regimen includes\nIsordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. Both of\nthese can be titrated upwards as his blood pressure allows. He has\nhad some labile blood pressures ranging anywhere from the systolics\nof 80s to 130s while in the hospital and he has never been\nsymptomatic and even when he has been , he has had blood pressures\nin the 80s and has tolerated this well. He is also maintained on\ndigoxin 0.375 mg q.d. He is also taking aspirin for his cardiac\nregimen.\n4. PULMONARY: The patient had good O2 saturations and usually\nranging from 95 to 97% on room air and has had no pulmonary\nproblems. He has had bibasilar crackles on exam which is felt to\nbe due to some mild congestive heart failure for which he is taking\nLasix. He may need some extra doses of Lasix per your directions\nthe next few days.\n5. HEME: The patient's hematocrit has been low in the high 20s on\ntwo occasions. In both cases always drifting down slowly thought\nto be due to delutional effects plus repeat a phlebotomy. He has\nbeen transfused a total of three units while he has been in the\nhospital here. Otherwise is hematocrit has been stable for\nmultiple days so has his platelets. Also of note the patient has\nbeen heme negative from below for more than ten days.\n6. RENAL: The patient says his baseline creatinine in which his\nacute renal failure has resolved.\n7. RHABDOMYOLYSIS: This has also resolved with the patient's CKs\nhaving normalized over a week ago.\n8. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient has remained afebrile , normal\nwhite count for many days. While here he was also presumptively\ntreated for C. diff which was actually found to be negative on his\nstool examinations with no fecal leukocytes. The patient's\ntemperature curve should be followed given that the patient\ncontinues to have pancreatitis and is at risk for developing a\nphlegmon.",
        "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN-12": "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN \n1. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient continues to be on TPN. A\nPICC line has been placed and a triple lumen catheter will be\nremoved prior to transfer of the patient. It is our feeling that\nthe patient should remain on TPN for the next two days and then as\nper your directions , the patient could be slowly advanced on a p.o.\ndiet as tolerated. We feel that the patient deserves another trial\nto see if he can tolerate p.o. before any long term decisions is\nmade regarding his nutrition and perhaps placement of a J-tube for\nlong term feeding. The patient's amylase and lipase on the day of\ndischarge are 47 for amylase and 166 for lipase. These values\ncontinue to remain low even when the patient was having abdominal\npain. This is felt to be due to a relatively burnt out pancreas.\nA GI consult was also obtained which agrees with this assessment.\nIt is felt that when the patient does start taking p.o. again he\nshould have pancreas at least 8 to 12 , 000 units t.i.d. half hour\nbefore meals due to his pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Also\nthe patient should be followed clinically very closely including\nhis white count , fever curve and his abdominal exam for any signs\nand symptoms of development of an infection or phlegmon or\npseudocyst because of his pancreatitis. The patient's TPN should\nbe continued as noted below.\n2. ENDOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY: The patient , as noted above , will\nrequire insulin , both through is TPN and his fingersticks should be\nchecked every six hours. As noted when the patient is switched\nover to a p.o. regimen , we suggest per endocrine recommendations\nthat NPH be given b.i.d. and the patient should be covered with an\ninsulin sliding scale at bedtime.\nThe patient is being transferred to Redist Nalereamer Memorial Hospital on\n2 of April in good condition.

The gastroparesis was thought to be secondary to his\ndiabetes. He was admitted to the medical service and his diet\nwas slowly increased. On the floor , his pain continued , and\nwithin two to three days , he began spiking fevers to 101 to 102.\nHe had a repeat abdominal CT , which showed a distended\ngallbladder with circumferential wall thickening and extensive\nstranding of the pericholecystic fat , which represented acute\nacalculous cholecystitis. Surgery was reconsulted , and the\npatient was taken to the operating room where he had an\nexploratory laparoscopy , which was then converted to an open\ncholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. The patient\nreceived perioperative vancomycin , Levaquin , and Flagyl and\ncontinued to do well post surgery with advancement of his diet\nand decrease in his pain medication requirement. Vancomycin was\ndiscontinued on 4/14/2006 after six days of vancomycin. He was\ncontinued on the Levaquin and Flagyl. He had a drain that was\nleft in following surgery , and this was pulled on 4/14/2006 .\nFollowing the pulling of the drain , he developed leakage of\ngreen-tinged serous fluid from his abdominal wound. An abdominal\nCT was done which showed a small fluid collection and no abscess.\nAn ERCP was done which showed a cystic duct stump bile leak.\nThey did a biliary sphincterotomy and stenting with no further\nleak. The patient was continued on empiric Levaquin and Flagyl\nfollowing the procedure. His diet was advanced and he tolerated\nthis well. He had no further pain. He is being discharged on a\ntotal of seven days of Levaquin and Flagyl following the bile\nleak.\nEndocrine: The patient was continued on lower-dose insulin while\nhe was n.p.o. and this was titrated up as his diet increased.\nCardiovascular: The patient was followed by the cardiac\ntransplant team. He was initially switched to IV cyclosporine\nand his CellCept was held. These were transitioned to p.o. and\nrestarted following his improvement. Postoperatively , he got\nstress-dose hydrocortisone instead of his prednisone and this was\nthen tapered to Solu-Medrol and then back to prednisone at his\nhome dose. He was fluid overloaded following the surgery. He\ngot 100 of IV Lasix times several doses , and then restarted on\nhis torsemide to maintain euvolemia. His Cartia was initially\ndiscontinued for a question of contribution to gastroparesis , but\nthis was then restarted. He was discharged on all his home\nmedications with the torsemide at a dose of 40 mg q.a.m.\nRheumatology: Following his surgery , he developed bilateral\nelbow pain , which was thought to be likely secondary to gout.\nThe rheumatology service was consulted. A left elbow tap was\nattempted , but this did not return any fluid. He was given\nseveral doses of colchicine p.r.n. with improvement. The steroid\ntaper was slowed and his gout improved. He was discharged\nwithout any elbow pain.\nPhlebitis: He developed left arm phlebitis secondary to an\ninfiltrating IV. This was covered by his antibiotics that were\nstarted for his cholecystitis and his arm improved.",

For this ,\nhe had a known ejection fraction of 20%. While he was in the\nhospital , he had strict I's and O's and was diuresed with Lasix\nand torsemide. His diureses was somewhat limited by systolic\nblood pressure with a range of 85 to 110 during his\nhospitalization. On discharge , his weight was down to 82.1 kg\nand was down from 87.5 on admission. The patient did have slight\nleak in his troponin of 0.1 on admission , but his EKG was\nunchanged and his enzymes x3 were negative except for the\ntroponin , which did not trend to higher. His cardiac medical\nregimen was maximized with an ACE inhibitor or statin and baby\naspirin was started on him. He was discharged home on torsemide\n100 mg daily in addition to his spironolactone dose.\n2. Pulmonary: The patient received Atrovent nebulizers in-house\nto help with his shortness of breath. His primary etiology ,\nhowever , was pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart\nfailure. His diuresis goal of 1.5 liter a day was achieved with\nthe combination of dopamine , nesiritide , and Lasix drips. He was\nmost responsive to combination of nesiritide and dopamine. At\nthe time of discharge , the patient's room air saturations were\n94% with ambulatory saturations of 86%. He was therefore\ndischarged home with oxygen to use overnight and when\nsymptomatic.\n3. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with diarrhea\nthat was felt to be related to his chemotherapy , which has been\ncompleted two weeks earlier. Stool was sent out for C.\ndifficile , which was negative. His colchicine was initially held\nbecause of his diarrhea , but the patient then developed a flare\nof his gout in his right great toe. Colchicine was resumed to\ntreat this with good results. The patient received palliative\nstent to his esophagus on 4/5/05 that is placed by Dr. Cap\nwithout complications. The patient had plans to follow up with\nis outpatient oncologist for ongoing care of his esophageal\ncancer after discharge.\n4. Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.7. His baseline\nchronic renal insufficiency was with the creatinine of\napproximately 1.3 to 1.5. At discharge , his creatinine was 1.6 ,\nwhich has been stable throughout his entire stay. He briefly\nrequired having a Foley catheter placed on 4/4/05 because of\nurinary retention , but it was removed the next day without\ndifficulty and did not have problems with voiding prior to\ndischarge.\n5. Hematology: The patient was placed on DVT prophylaxis with\nLovenox. He did exhibit some right leg edema more pronounced\nthan his left leg edema , but this is felt to be due to his gout\nin his right great toe.\nThe patient was discharged to home with services and PT was\narranged to go and do a home safety evaluation.",

She underwent high-dose\nchemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in 6/22 .  Her\ntransplant was complicated by worsening of her baseline impaired\nlung function , and she has been oxygen dependent since the time\nof transplant. In 4/9 , she began to have back pain and\neventually was shown to have recurrent or increasing disease in\nthe retroperitoneum by abdominal CT ( paraaortic at the level of\nL2 ). The decision was made to pursue radiation therapy to this\narea , which she completed on 10/4/05 . The patient presented\nwith complaints of pain in the mid lower back radiating in a\nband-like distribution around the waist to the abdomen as well as\ninto the right hip and buttock area. The pain also radiated into\nthe right thigh with movement for weightbearing. The patient\nreports the pain was occasionally associated with numbness in the\nright lateral thigh. She denied any radiation of the pain to\nbelow the knee. She denied any numbness in the lower legs , back\nor saddle area. She denied any change in bowel or bladder\nfunction.\nThe patient had fluoroscopic LP on 6/18/05 with a glucose of 69 ,\na total protein of 49.3 , and cytology which was negative. Plain\nfilms of her hip showed enthesopathy of the superior pelvis\nbilaterally , lower lumbar spine degeneration , and sclerotic focus\nin the proximal region of the right femur. MRI of the lumbar\nspine on 8/5/05 showed an irregular soft tissue mass within the\nretroperitoneum centered anterior to the spine at the level of\nL2 , position posterior to the IVC and right lateral aorta\nmeasuring 4.5 x 2.7 x 3.4 cm; there is a lesion involving the\nanterior superior aspect to the L2 vertebral body continuous with\nthe anterior paraspinal mass with wedging and probable pathologic\ncompression fracture.

Oncology: CT of the thoracic , lumbar , and sacral spine on\n8/18/05 showed no evidence of cord compression but did show a\ncompression fracture at L2. IR was consulted on 4/18/05\nregarding the possibility of kyphoplasty to this area; however ,\nthey deferred further treatment , as the pain was thought to be\nsecondary to hip pathology rather than lumbar spine pathology.\nCT of the right hip on 4/18/05 showed a lytic lesion in the\nposterior acetabulum with an associated fracture. The patient\nwas evaluated by Orthopedic Oncology as well as Radiation\nOncology. Dr. Cestia with Orthopedic Oncology deferred any\nsurgical intervention until the completion of radiation therapy.\nThe patient started radiation therapy to the right hip on\n3/29/05 . The contact in Radiation Oncology is Britt L Redden , M.D. , pager number 28468. The plan is for the\npatient to complete a course of 18 treatments of radiation to the\nright hip.

She has been tapering off of the Decadron and will\nbe discharged on 4 mg p.o. q.a.m. with taper as listed in the\ndischarge instructions. Once the patient has completed Decadron\n2 mg p.o. q.a.m. x3 doses , she should then be started on\nprednisone 10 mg p.o. daily per her home dosing for pulmonary\ndisease. The patient did receive pamidronate 90 mg IV x1 during\nthis hospitalization.\n3. ID: UA on admission was more or less benign , and urine\nculture remained negative. The patient was afebrile throughout\nher hospitalization. She was given a five-day course of\nacyclovir 200 mg p.o. five times per day for concern of recurrent\ngenital herpes.

The patient also has a history of coronary\nartery disease , status post non-ST elevation myocardial\ninfarction. She presented with chest pain in 2001 and had a\ntroponin I , which peaked at 25. Cardiac catheterization revealed\na left-sided occlusion and percutaneous coronary intervention was\nunsuccessful. A subsequent adenosine mibi in September 2002\nrevealed normal left ventricular function and no perfusion\ndefects. The patient has since been admitted for left chest\npain , last in February 2005 , which has been attributed to her\nshoulder arthritis. She ruled out for myocardial infarction at\nthat time and chest CT scans were also negative. Today , the\npatient was talking to her son on the phone when she went to\nretrieve a pen and her left knee gave out and she suffered a\nmechanical fall to the floor. She struck her left forehead\nagainst a dresser. She did not have any loss of consciousness\nand also denied chest pain , shortness of breath , or palpitations.\nThere were no focal neurological deficits and no actively\ninflamed joints.

The patient has had severe\nischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately\n20% , and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. He underwent\na 4-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with a left internal\nmammary artery to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein\ngrafts to the LVB , D1 and first obtuse marginal on 19 of October His\npostoperative course was complicated by a sternal wound infection ,\nwith debridement performed on 15 of May He was put on vancomycin\nand sent home 3 days prior to admission on intravenous vancomycin.\nHe felt okay , until 1 or 2 days prior to admission when he had\nincreased dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath. He also\ncomplained of increasing orthopnea and a mild cough accompanied by\nshaking chills the night prior to admission. He also complained of\nmild upper and lower back pain. The patient denied dysuria. PAST\nMEDICAL HISTORY is as noted above. The patient has no known drug\nALLERGIES.

SOCIAL HISTORY revealed\nthe patient lives with his wife , he is an exposed smoker and\noccasional ethanol drinker. He is retired secondary to his\ncardiomyopathy. He was able to ambulate and play golf prior to the\ncoronary artery bypass grafting in October .",

Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination\nshowed extraocular movements were intact , pupils equal , round ,\nreactive to light , oropharynx benign. Neck was supple with no\nlymphadenopathy. Chest showed left base bronchial breath sounds\nwith egophony , with a few scattered wheezes throughout.\nCardiovascular examination showed JVP approximately 8 centimeters ,\ncarotids were I+ bilaterally , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm ,\nS1 , S2 , very distant heart sounds. The liver edge was palpable.\nAbdomen was nontender , positive bowel sounds. Skin showed the\nupper chest wound where debridement had taken place , approximately\n6 centimeters long at the incisional site , which was slightly\ntender and erythematous. Back showed no costovertebral angle\ntenderness. Extremities showed the patient had TEDS stockings on ,\nthere was trace edema , II+ pulses bilaterally. Neurologic\nexamination showed the patient was alert and oriented , fluent , and\nthe examination was nonfocal.",
        "LABORATORY EXAMINATION-5": "LABORATORY EXAMINATION  On admission , SMA-7 showed sodium 135 ,\npotassium 5.1 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate\n22 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 128. CK was 13 , triponin 0.0.\nProthrombin time was 14.1 , partial thromboplastin time 27.5.\nDigoxin level was 0.6. Complete blood count showed white blood\ncount 7.8 , differential 69 neutrophils , 16 lymphs , 7 monos , 8\neosinophils , hematocrit 28.7 , platelets 735 , 000. Sputum from\n27 of January showed 4+ Hemophilus influenza , which was pan sensitive.\nChest x-ray on the date of admission showed a left lower lobe\ninfiltrate with possible effusion. Electrocardiogram showed left\nbundle branch block. VQ scan was low probability.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-6": "HOSPITAL COURSE  1. Infectious disease. The patient had a\nmaximum temperature of 102.3 on 27 of February He was\non vancomycin , gentamicin and ceftazidime. On 13 of June , gentamicin\nand ceftazidime were discontinued , and ofloxacin was started\nsecondary to decreasing creatinine. After his temperature spike on\n21 of August , the patient's maximum temperature declined each of the\nfollowing days , and he has remained afebrile the last 2 days. The\nsternal wound appeared less erythematous , and he was continued on\nvancomycin for the coagulase negative Staphylococcus that grew from\nthe wound site on 15 of May The patient had a computerized\ntomography scan of his chest to rule out an abscess at the sternal\nwound site and no abscess was seen. Thoracentesis was done on the\nleft pleural effusion , and the tap was an exudate with pH 7.51 ,\nglucose 114 , total protein 4.9 , amylase 16 , LDH 38. There were 756\nwhite blood cells on differential , of which 93% macrophages and 7%\nmesothelioma cells , 127 , 000 red blood cells , and the fluid was\ngrossly blood. Cultures from the fluid were negative for bacteria\nand fungal growth. Gram stain showed no organisms , no\npolymorphonuclear cells. Vancomycin was redosed to 1 gram every 48\nhours secondary to increased creatinine and elevated levels. Given\nhis recent requirement for debridement , vancomycin will be\ncontinued for 2 weeks after discharge. Ofloxacin will also be\ncontinued for the same. All cultures from this hospitalization are\nnegative to date.\n2. Cardiovascular. The patient ruled out for myocardial\ninfarction. VQ scan was low probability on admission. This was\nperformed secondary to his baseline tachycardia. Lower extremity\nnoninvasive studies and ultrasound were done and were negative for\ndeep vein thrombosis. The patient's triponin on admission was 0.0.\nThe patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initial\ndyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestive\nheart failure. His admission weight was 100.6 kilograms , and\nweight on discharge was 95.8 kilograms. With aggressive diuresis\nduring hospitalization , Lasix was discontinued on the day prior to\ndischarge. Digoxin level on admission was 0.6 , on discharge was\n1.0. The patient had several episodes of hypotension with systolic\nblood pressure in the mid 70's to low 80's. Captopril and\nLopressor were decreased and held at certain stages during his\nhospitalization. On discharge , he was on a stable dose of\nCaptopril , 6.25 milligrams 3 times a day , and Lopressor , 12.5\nmilligrams twice a day. He was not orthostatic on the day prior to\ndischarge.\n3. Renal. The patient was aggressively diuresed. His BUN and\ncreatinine rose from 12 and 1.2 on admission , to a peak of 36 and\n2.6 on 20 of November Subsequently , the creatinine has declined , and on\n9 of July , BUN was 37 , creatinine 2.2. The patient had an\neosinophilia , which peaked at 18% on 16 of March , and subsequently\ndecreased to 11% on discharge. Urine eosinophils were not present.\nIt appeared that his eosinophilia was related to ceftazidime , which\nwas discontinued on 24 of January It is unlikely that his increasing\nrenal insufficiency is secondary to acute tubular necrosis. More\nlikely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken to\ndecrease his congestive heart failure. Follow-up laboratory values\nwill likely reveal improvement in BUN and creatinine status , as\nwell as a decrease in his peripheral eosinophilia.\n4. Psychiatry. The patient has had anxiety , especially at night ,\nand has been treated successfully with Ativan , but Serax resulted\nin nightmares. The patient has a history of depression and may\nbenefit from counseling. The patient's decreased oral intake ,\nnightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlying\ndepressive component over his prolonged illness.\n5. Endocrine. The patient's blood sugar levels have been well\ncontrolled on a regimen of NPH , 20 each morning.

Attempted diuresis with\nDiuril , Lasix IV , and finally nesiritide. Nesiritide\ndiscontinued on 7/11/05 .  Torsemide was started on 7/11/05 with\nimproved diuresis. The patient has consistently refused\ndialysis. Blood pressure was controlled during this\nhospitalization with hydralazine , Isordil , and Lopressor. All\nmedications were stopped on 6/12/05 .  Ejection fraction 35%.\nb. Ischemia - enzymes peaked on 4/13/05 with a CK of 152 , an MB\nof 39.6 , and a troponin of 21.44. EKG at this time showed ST\ndepressions in V4 through V6. The recommendation of the\nCardiology team was that the patient undergo cardiac\ncatheterization. The patient refused any intervention with\ncardiac catheterization due to concerns of further damage to her\nkidneys. A decision was made to medically manage the patient.\nShe was briefly on heparin while this decision was concluded , and\nheparin was stopped on 7/6/05 with enzymes trending down , and\nno evidence of active ischemia.\nc. Rhythm - the patient had bursts of normal sinus ventricular\ntachycardia on telemetry. She was maintained on a low-dose\nbeta-blocker until 7/11/05 .  She has been in a normal sinus\nrhythm from 4/13/05 through 6/12/05 .\n2. Pulmonary: The patient has an oxygen requirement of 2 liters\nsecondary to a right pleural effusion and congestive heart\nfailure. The patient's IV diuretics were stopped on 6/12/05 in\nconsideration of changing goals of care. If the patient becomes\nshort of breath in the absence of diuretics , we would recommend\nmorphine elixir 10 mg q.2 h. as needed for shortness of breath.\n3. Renal: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency was likely\nsecondary to hypertension and diabetes. MRA on 4/13/05 to\nevaluate for renal artery stenosis showed right renal artery\nstenosis. The patient's creatinine increased to 4 on 7/11/05 ,\nlikely secondary to diuresis. Ultrasound was refused. The Renal\nconsult team was following , but the patient refused any dialysis.\n4. Endo: The patient's diabetes was controlled with Lantus\ninsulin and an aspart insulin sliding scale. There was concern\nfor hypoglycemia on 6/12/05 in the setting with no oral intake.\nAll of the patient's diabetic medications have been stopped at\nthis time.\n5. Psychiatry: The Psychiatry consult team was consulted for\nmajor depressive disorder. There was concern for delirium.\nCelexa was started for depression. Seroquel was tried p.r.n. for\ninsomnia and delirium , but it was stopped due to change in mental\nstatus. The patient was able to make her own medical decisions\nat the time of refusing cardiac catheterization. She understood\nthe risk of refusing cardiac catheterization. We will continue\nno psychiatric medications at the time of discharge. May\nconsider Haldol for concern regarding worsening delirium.\n6. The patient is currently DNR/DNI , comfort measures only.

She had a\nskin abrasion on her left elbow. She had no spinal tenderness , no\npelvic tenderness. She was unable to raise her right leg secondary\nto pain. She did have pain with straight leg left on the right.\nShe had normal sensation in upper and lower extremities.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-9": "HOSPITAL COURSE  Patient was admitted and was scheduled to undergo\nan MRI for evaluation of acutely herniated disc\nat an outside facility at Y Wau Topelum , secondary to not being able to\nfit within the coils at our own facility. However , she was unable\nto receive this MRI secondary to inability to have assistance with\ntransfer of her when she reached the facility. Initially , her pain\nwas managed with both immediate-release and sustained-release\nmorphine and Valium for spasm. She also received around-the-clock\nhigh-dose NSAIDs and was evaluated by physical therapy and\nnutrition. Her UTI was treated with Bactrim. On hospital day\nthree , her creatinine jumped to 2.9 from 1.4. She was also\nhyperkalemic to 5.9. Her NSAIDs were stopped and Neurontin was\nDCed secondary to somnolence. However , she continued to have\nworsening renal failure , hypertension and somnolence , and blood gas\nshowed primary respiratory acidosis , hypercarbia and she was\nultimately transferred to the MICU for intubation for airway\nprotection secondary to aspiration. By April , her creatinine had\nreturned to baseline. She was extubated without complications.\nHer renal function was presumed to be secondary high-dose NSAIDs ,\nand her intubation was deemed to be secondary to a primary\nrespiratory acidosis from opioid intoxication exacerbated by renal\nfailure. Issues are as follows by systems:\nPulmonary: Overnight pulse oximetry was performed , which will be\nanalyzed to assess for obstructive sleep apnea. Patient will most\nlikely need a form of sleep study at rehabilitation or as an\noutpatient to address this obstructive sleep apnea issue. Data\nfrom this admission do not support a diagnosis of obesity\nhypoventilation syndrome , because there was no daytime hypercapnia\nby both ABGs and Chem-7 panel.\nRenal: Acute renal insufficiency resolved with hydration ,\nwithdrawal of NSAIDs. We will hold her ACE inhibitor secondary to\nrecent renal failure , and she will need to have this evaluated in\ntwo weeks or so.\nInfectious disease: The patient with low-grade fevers on empiric\nLevofloxacin and Flagyl day seven of 14 for aspiration pneumonia\nsuffered during hypocarbic respiratory arrest. The patient was\nalso placed on two days of vancomycin , after one of the blood\ncultures in the ICU grew coagulase negative Staph. All cultures\nsince then have been negative. Patient also had two episodes of\nliquid stool on Flagyl , day six. She was already receiving therapy\nfor C. difficile. Because she has been in the hospital more than\nthree days , an O&P is very low yield. Stool cultures and a repeat\nchest x-ray will be done if clinical worsens tomorrow.\nNeurologic: Patient with known small right lateral recess disc\nherniation impinging on right nerve root at L5-S1. She has\nprevious received steroid injections for this and has refused\nsurgery secondary to very bad experience with the total abdominal\nhysterectomy complicated by wound infection. She has had an acute\nexacerbation of this pain with her fall. We were unable to obtain\nan MRI at outside facility because of her body habitus and need for\nassistance with movement. She would benefit from aggressive PT and\npain control with eventual surgery if these more conservative\nmeasures fail.\nPain: The patient was oversedated on pain medications and was\nactually intubated for the need to balance desire to alleviate pain\nwith need for patient to have adequate respiratory drive.\nEndocrine: Continue NPH and CZI and ADA diet. Will begin Meridia.\nPatient also seen by nutrition and was given number for weight loss\nprogram.",
        "CV-10": "CV  Non-Q-wave MI in September , 2001. Patient with preserved EF , no\nvalve disease. Will continue current cardiac regimen. Will need\nto restart ACE inhibitor in two to three weeks , now that renal\nfailure resolved.\nProphylaxis: Subcutaneous Heparin , Protime pump inhibitor , and\nDulcolax and Lactulose p.r.n. for constipation while on narcotics.\nSocial: I have written a letter regarding the patient's need for\nfirst-floor apartment secondary to inability to use stairs. It is\nin her chart.\nAdditional comments: Please monitor patient carefully for\noversedation on current medications. Patient will need sleep study\nto rule out obstructive sleep apnea.",

In the past five years the patient has also\nbecome morbidly obese with a weight of greater than 200 pounds.\nSince 1995 she has noted development of significant bilateral lower\nextremity swelling. In October of 1996 she was treated for diabetic\nstasis ulcers on both of her legs with cellulitis requiring home IV\nantibiotics. Part of the bilateral lower extremity swelling was\nattributed to the presence of a large uterine fibroid which was\nthought to be compromising venous return. Her massive edema was\ntreated unsuccessfully with Lasix.\nThe patient was doing well until about a week prior to admission\nwhen she developed some diarrhea consisting of two to three bowel\nmovements a day. Her stool was watery brown without any blood or\nmucus. She also reported some nausea and vomiting as well as\nchills. She believes that she had fevers , but these temperatures\nwere not measured. One day after the onset of her diarrhea the\npatient noted the development of burning pain on her left anterior\nthigh just above her knee. This was associated with increased\nerythema and mildly increased swelling in that area. She reports\nthat her diarrhea , there had been stool running down her left thigh\nthe previous day. This area of erythema on her left leg\nsubsequently spread to the lateral surface of the thigh and was\nassociated with increasing pain. The pain was so severe that it\nprevented the patient from her daily activities and from walking.\nThe patient presented to the Emergency Department on 4/8 for\nworsening of her lower extremity pain and decreased p.o. intake.\nOn the day of admission the patient states that her diarrhea had\nresolved and that she has had no abdominal pain. She has had no\nchest pain or shortness of breath or any other localizing signs of\ninfection except her left leg. On admission she was found to have\na temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and she was placed in the\nShort Stay Unit. Subsequently her admission labs were noted to\nreveal elevated LFTs and an elevated BUN and creatinine with a\nwhite blood cell count of 35 , 000. Because of these abnormalities\nand renal failure , the patient was transferred out of the Short\nStay Unit to the General Medicine team for further care.",

Her\ntemperature was 99.4 , blood pressure 110/74 , pulse rate of 92 ,\nrespiratory rate 20 , O2 sat 96% on room air. Her HEENT exam was\nnonicteric with moist oropharynx and no lesions. The neck was\nsupple without any lymphadenopathy. She had a right EJ IV line.\nThere were no carotid bruits. Her lungs were clear to auscultation\nwith no CVA tenderness. Her heart was regular rate and rhythm.\nThere was a faint S4 and a loud P2 component to the S2 sound. Her\nabdominal exam was obese , non-positive for bowel sounds. There was\nmild tenderness over the periumbilical region with some fullness/\nsuggestion of a mass. There was no rebound or guarding , no right\nupper quadrant tenderness , no hepatomegaly/splenomegaly ( exam\nlimited by obesity ). Her extremity exam revealed marked bilateral\nswelling in both lower extremities with chronic stasis changes.\nThere were multiple venous plaques on the pretibial areas of both\nlegs with one venous plaque being ulcerated on the right pretib\narea. Examination of her left thigh revealed a patch of erythema\nand warmth that was very tender to the touch. Neurologic exam was\nalert and oriented times three , intact cranial nerves III-XII.\nThere was slight decrease in sensation in the patient's lower\nextremity , left greater than right to pin sensation. Her motor\nexam was otherwise unremarkable. Her rectal exam was reported to\nbe guaiac negative per the Emergency Department.",
        "LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION-10": "LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION  Sodium 133 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 43 , and\ncreatinine of 3.7. The patient's last\ncreatinine value on record was in September of 1996 which was 0.6. Her\nLFTs revealed an ALT of 71 , AST of 57 , LDH 717 , alkaline\nphosphatase 196 , total bilirubin 1.1 , direct bilirubin 0.6. Her\namylase was 8. Her albumin was 2.1 and her calcium was 8.2. Her\nCBC on admission revealed a white cell count of 34 , 000 , hematocrit\nof 29 , and platelets of 624 , 000. The differential on the white\nblood cell count was 78 polys , 38 bands , 6 lymphs , 3 monocytes , and\nno eos. Her MCV on her hematocrit was 77. Her PT and PTT were\nboth within normal limits. Her urinalysis revealed 3+ protein , 1+\nleukocyte esterase , 8-12 white blood cells , 20-25 red blood cells ,\nand 2+ squamous epithelial cells.\nChest x-ray on admission revealed low lung volumes with possible\nleft total effusion that was blurring left lower lobe air space\ndisease. Abdominal ultrasound performed on admission revealed no\nhydronephrosis , a normal liver biliary system. Study was limited\nsecondary to body habitus. Lower extremity non-invasive studies\nrevealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. However , exam was\nlimited secondary to habitus.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE  By issues\n1. Left thigh cellulitis: The patient was started on Ancef\nrenally dosed for her left thigh cellulitis. Her legs were kept\nraised and her white blood cell and fever curves followed. An\nInfectious Disease consult as well as a Dermatology consult was\nobtained to assist with antibiotics as well as dressing for her\nlower extremity changes. Blood cultures and wound cultures sent\ndid not reveal any organisms. Because of the patient's very high\nwhite blood cell count , the ID consult team was concerned for the\npossibility of toxic shock syndrome; therefore , Clindamycin IV was\nalso added to her regimen of antibiotics. Also per ID\nrecommendation , stool cultures were sent for E. coli 0167: H7 which\nwas negative. Although there was an initial fall in the patient's\nwhite count during the first several days of antibiotics , this\nwhite count subsequently began rising again. This was associated\nwith continued poor resolution of the pain in the patient's left\nthigh and perhaps worsening erythema. Because the patient's left\nleg did not appear to be getting better on antibiotics , a Surgical\nconsult was obtained to rule out a deeper seated infection in the\npatient's thigh. Imaging of the patient's leg with MRI was\nattempted but was unsuccessful secondary to the patient's large\nsize. A CT of both of her legs were obtained instead which\nrevealed no evidence of an abscess in her left leg , however , it did\nincidentally detect a large effusion in the patient's left knee.\nOne week after admission the patient noted acute worsening of the\npain in her left knee. Because of the known left knee effusion , a\nconcern for a septic knee joint was raised. A Rheumatology consult\nwas obtained. The left knee was tapped using ultrasound guidance\nremoving 20 cc of turbid knee fluid. Studies on the left knee\neffusion revealed 13 , 000 white blood cells with negative gram stain\nand negative crystal exam times 3. Cultures of the left knee fluid\ndid not grow any organisms. Despite these findings , we were still\nconcerned that this was a partially treated septic joint given the\npatient had been on antibiotics for one week. For this reason an\nOrthopedic consult was obtained and the patient was taken to the OR\nfor possible debridement. On 6/19 the patient was taken to the\nOperating Room where an abscess on the left lateral distal thigh\nwas found and drained. A total of approximately 20 cc of pus was\nremoved by Dr. Sudler . There was no connection between the pus\ncollection and the left knee effusion. After the drainage , the\npatient's clinical status improved dramatically with a decrease in\nher white count and increased mobility of her leg. She was\ncontinued on Ancef IV and p.o. Ofloxacillin which had been added\nfor gram negative coverage. The Clindamycin was subsequently\ndiscontinued. On the day prior to discharge the patient's white\nblood cell count had fallen to 10 , 000. She remained afebrile.\n2. Renal: On admission the patient was noted to have a creatinine\nof 3.7 with a baseline known to be 0.6 in September of 1996. However , on\nsearching through the patient's records it appears that the patient\nhad been noted to have increased proteinuria since September of 1996.\nThe acute renal failure was initially thought to be secondary to\ndehydration; the patient was given IV hydration with no improvement\nin her creatinine. For that reason , a Renal consult was obtained\non the third day of admission. It was the impression of the Renal\nService that the patient's acute renal failure was likely\nmultifactorial secondary to a combination of diabetic nephropathy ,\nlow albumin , volume loss secondary to diarrhea , infection , and\nmedications which included NSAIDs as well as ACE inhibitor. For\nthat reason , the patient's nephrotoxic medications , which include\nLisinopril and Metformin , were discontinued. The patient's\nelectrolytes and volume status was followed closely for the rest of\nthe course of the hospitalization with continued gradual\nimprovement. Her creatinine peaked at 4.7. On discharge the\npatient's creatinine had resolved back to 2.2.\n3. Right upper extremity swelling: On the day after the patient\nreturned from the Operating Room for the drainage of her left\nthigh , she was found to have new onset of swelling in her right arm\nand breast. Initially we were concerned for the presence of a\nright upper extremity deep venous thrombosis. Upper extremity\nnon-invasive studies were obtained which were negative for any\nclots. An echocardiogram was also obtained showing no evidence of\nright heart dysfunction. A nuclear flow study was also attempted\nbut was unsuccessful because of the failure to obtain venous access\non the patient's right arm. The Leahgulf Mary Katon Hospital team was also\nconsulted regarding the use of heparin. However , given that the\npatient had poor access and had an anemia , it was decided that the\npatient would not be heparinized. Her right upper extremity\nswelling was observed closely and with elevation of the right arm\nover the next few days gradually resolved without any\ncomplications. On the day prior to discharge a repeat right upper\nextremity ultrasound was obtained which revealed no evidence of\nblood clots in her right arm.\n4. Hematology: On admission the patient was found to have a low\nhematocrit with a low MVC. Iron studies were performed which\nrevealed the likely presence of iron deficiency. For that reason\nthe patient was placed on iron sulfate 30 mg t.i.d. The patient\nwas guaiac negative , thus ruling out evidence of a chronic GI\nbleed. The patient's anemia is also likely a reflection of her\nrenal dysfunction.\n5. GI: Although the patient had experienced some diarrhea prior\nto admission , her diarrhea resolved in the hospital. All of her\nstool studies were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed no\nabnormalities in the patient's liver or biliary system to account\nfor the mild transaminitis found on admission. It is likely that\nthe patient had a bout of viral gastroenteritis a few days prior to\nadmission which resolved spontaneously.",

Torsade de pointes status post DC cardioversion: Given his\nhistory of torsade de pointes requiring cardioversion , upon\npresentation to Neysing Areid Risbanks Hospital , Mr. Mazikowski\nelectrolytes were vigorously repleted. He underwent an ischemic\nworkup for the etiology for his initial presentation. He\ncontinued to have a prolonged QT interval and therefore medicated\nfailed to exacerbate his already long QT interval , at baseline\nwere discontinued. He was discontinued from his Celexa and\nlevofloxacin. Throughout the remainder of his hospital course ,\nMr. Gift was closely monitored via telemetry and was noted to\nhave no further events of ventricular tachycardia.\n2. Ischemia: When he presented , the ischemic etiology for his\nventricular tachycardia was considered. He was maintained on\naspirin and also continued on his Plavix. A cardiac\ncatheterization was done on 7/24/05 , which showed 30% occlusion\nof the left anterior descending proximal coronary artery , 65%\nocclusion of the ramus , 30% occlusion of the mid circumflex\nartery , 50% occlusion of the marginal 1 artery , and 100%\nocclusion of the distal RCA. None of these lesions were felt to\nhave caused his ischemia such that it would have been the\netiological factor for his torsades. He was followed throughout\nhis hospital course by the Electrophysiology Service.\n3. Hypertension: While in the CCU , the patient had an echo ,\nwhich showed severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with\nan ejection fraction of 55%. He was started on vigorous\nafter-load reduction , which was titrated to his blood pressure\nthroughout his hospital course. At the time of discharge , he was\ntaking Lopressor , lisinopril , Norvasc , Isordil , and hydralazine.\n4. End-stage renal disease: The patient was continued on his\nrepeat dialysis with close follow up from the Renal Service. He\nunderwent regular dialysis on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday while\nat Apseph's Danale Hospital .  His electrolytes were followed\ndaily and repleted as needed.\n5. Seizure disorder: The patient , although on presentation was\nbelieved to have had a tonic-clonic seizure. He was maintained\non his Keppra throughout his course and was seizure-free while\nhospitalized.\n6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient presented with markedly\nlabile blood sugars. While admitted to the CCU , he was placed on\nthe Portland protocol in order to maintain tight glycemic\ncontrol. He was followed by the Endocrine Team , who recommended\nswitch to Lantus for basal control and regular insulin prior to\nmeals. His glucose levels were followed daily and his insulin\nregimen was titrated in order to attain appropriate glycemic\ncontrol.\n7. Nutrition: The patient was initially started on tube feeds\nfor nutrition. A NG tube was placed secondary to his altered\nmental status. However , during his hospitalization , he had\nmultiple episodes of agitations , during which he pulled out his\nNG tube. He was trialed with a soft diet after consultation with\nthe Speech and Swallow Service on 2/1 .  As he was able to\ntolerate these p.o. feeds , this diet was continued.",

He returns now with increased\ncough productive of white phlegm and progressive dyspnea on\nexertion. The patient has a history of breast carcinoma in 1989 ,\ntreated with left lumpectomy x 2 and XRT , accompanied by\nchemotherapy completed in early 1990. The patient then presented in\nJuly of 1992 with progressive dyspnea on exertion , found to have\nan ejection fraction of 17%. She was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy\nfelt secondary to Adriamycin toxicity. She was then treated with\nDigoxin , Lasix , Captopril and Coumadin with good result. She had\nsubsequent development of SVT with a rapid ventricular rate of\napproximately 180. The patient eventually underwent EPEP studies\nwith therapeutic ablation. Subsequently she had done quite well\nuntil February of 1994 when she presented with mild cough\nproductive of white phlegm and increasing symptoms of right and\nleft-sided heart failure. She was treated with increased Lasix and\nDigoxin and an empiric course of amoxicillin with little change in\nher symptoms. She was then admitted on 8/7 after she was found to\nhave a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient underwent\nultrasound guided thoracentesis complicated by a pneumothorax\nrequiring chest tube placement. Evaluation of the pleural fluid\nrevealed a transudative effusion with all cultures and cytology\nremaining negative. The patient was treated with Ancef for\napproximately 7 days while the chest tube was in place and then\ndischarged on 6/20/94. Since that time the patient has had no\nimprovement in her symptoms but rather notes increasing cough which\nremains productive of white sputum with occasional \"specks of red\"\nand progression of her dyspnea on exertion. She is now unable to\ngo greater than six steps of stair without significant dyspnea.\nThis is a significant change from approximately one month ago where\nshe was able to go two flights without extreme difficulty. She has\nstable 3 + pillow orthopnea and pedal edema. Her weight has\nincreased only slightly recently. She denies any fever , chills ,\nsweats , chest discomfort or pleuritic chest pain.

EKG showed sinus rhythm at 98 , left axis deviation ,\nnormal intervals , low voltage with poor R wave progression , no\nsignificant change compared with 7/24/94.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted with a picture of chronic\nproductive cough , progressive dyspnea with low\ngrade fevers and increased white blood cell count , in addition to\nnew opacity on chest x-ray. This clinical picture was felt to be\nmostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed on\nunderlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructive\ninfection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. The\npatient was started on empiric course of antibiotics including\ncefotaxime and clarithromycin. She was seen in consultation by the\nPulmonary Service which felt that a therapeutic trial of aggressive\ndiuresis was warranted prior to any more aggressive intervention\nsuch as bronchoscopy or repeat thoracentesis. The patient was thus\ntreated with aggressive IV diuresis with excellent symptomatic\nresult. As her symptoms and chest x-ray cleared , it was felt that\na chest CT would be valuable in evaluating her left lower lobe for\npossible endobronchial lesion leading to volume loss. She thus\nunderwent a chest CT on 2/6/94 with demonstration of a large\nperipheral , red , right lower lobe opacity , highly suggestive of a\nright lower lobe pulmonary infarction. No endobronchial lesions or\nlymphadenopathy were noted. Given the patient's history of dilated\ncardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of the\nchest CT findings with the Chest Radiologist and Pulmonary Consult\nTeam , it was felt that the patient should be treated empirically\nfor a pulmonary embolus. She was thus started on IV Heparin with\nachievement of therapeutic PTT prior to switching to oral Coumadin\nwithout complications. In addition the patient underwent lower\nextremity non-invasives which were negative for deep venous\nthrombosis as well as a cardiac echocardiogram which showed no\nevidence of RV strain or right ventricular thrombus. Of note , this\nechocardiogram again demonstrated moderately large left ventricle\nwith severely depressed systolic function and an estimated ejection\nfraction of 15-20%. Though the possibility that the wedge shaped\nopacification seen on CT was due to pneumonia rather than\ninfarction , it was felt that given the patient's low ejection\nfraction she would need to be anticoagulated on this basis alone ,\nand thus pulmonary angiogram or VQ scan would not be likely to\nalter management. The patient was discharged to home.",

She\nhad angina in April 1992 and underwent coronary angiography in\nOctober 1993 which revealed an 80% RCA lesion , 70% OM , 70% mid-LAD ,\nand 50% D1. The LV-gram was normal. She had a PTCA to the RCA\nlesion with a 30% residual. She had recurrent exertional angina\none month later and a repeat catheterization at that time showed no\nchange. In February 1993 , she had several episodes of lightheadedness\nand syncope which was felt to be secondary to sick sinus\nsyndrome. A DDD pacemaker was placed. She later had recurrent\nchest pain at rest and again went to cardiac catheterization which\nshowed a 70% mid LAD lesion , 30% RCA , and a normal LV-gram with 75%\nejection fraction. She underwent PTCA to the mid-LAD lesion with a\n20% residual. She was then discharged on Lopressor , Procardia , and\nAspirin. In February 1993 , she underwent an ETT , and exercised\n4 minutes and 35 seconds on a standard Bruce stopping due to\nshortness of breath and fatigue. No ischemic changes were noted.\nShe has done well until two days prior to admission when she\nexperienced recurrent angina at rest , and was admitted to\nTionwell Swellmo Hospital where she ruled out for a\nmyocardial infarction. She was discharged one day prior to\nadmission and on the day of admission had recurrent angina while\ndoing housework. She took three Nitroglycerins , and the pain was\nrelieved. Her primary physician recommended that she be seen in\nhe Emergency Room.",

Carotids were 2+\nbilaterally without bruits. Lungs: Rales were heard at the right\nbase. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , and a II/VI\nsystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. Abdomen: A midline scar\nwas noted , otherwise soft , nontender , without hepatosplenomegaly.\nExtremities: 2+ bilateral femoral pulses , dorsalis pedis pulses ,\nno edema. Neurological exam: Alert and oriented times three.",
        "LABORATORY DATA-6": "LABORATORY DATA  Sodium 139 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 18 , creatinine\n0.8. The first CK was 120. The white blood\ncount was 6.9 , hematocrit 38.6 , platelets 177. The PT was 13.1 ,\nand the PTT was 57.3 ( possibly drawn off a line which had been\nhep-flushed ). EKG: Sinus bradycardia at a rate of 59 , left axis\ndeviation , left ventricular hypertrophy , nonspecific T-wave\nabnormalities.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was continued on her Lopressor ,\nAspirin , and Nifedipine. Nitro Paste was added\non admission. On 3/30/93 , she underwent cardiac catheterization\nwhich showed a 30% RCA lesion and a 30% proximal LAD. No other\nlesions were seen. Her medications were continued except for\nchanging her Lopressor to Atenolol 50 mg q.d. She was monitored\nover a weekend until she could have an exercise test. She had some\nbelching during this time , and Propulcid was added to her medical\nregimen. On 5/23/93 , the patient underwent a standard Bruce\nprotocol ETT and went 4 minutes and 30 seconds , stopping due to\nshortness of breath and fatigue. There were no EKG changes or\narrhythmias noted during exercise , and there was no evidence of\nischemia.
