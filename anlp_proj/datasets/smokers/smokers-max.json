gentamicin and flagyl for two days and then switched to unasyn 3 grams per day. the patient was initially febrile, but then became afebrile on antibiotic therapy. the patient was evaluated for long term therapy. the patient developed increasing ascites in conjunction with her bacterial peritonitis, and was placed on diuretics with aldactone and lasix. marked abdominal tenderness was noted due to a bacterial peritonitis, which gradually cleared over several days. because of the patient ' s history of asystole, she was discussed with dr. white as a possible transplant candidate. he felt that significant coronary artery disease should be ruled out. for that reason a gaited blood pool scan was done with a 45 % ejection fraction. a persantine thallium stress test was done, which was negative for ischemia. her", "3": "diabetes mellitus was managed on a sliding scale, and she had one episode of hypoglycemia, secondary to fasting. the patient was officially evaluated for transplantation by dr. white, who felt, although there was no absolute contraindication to transplantation, that her multiple medical problems made her a poor candidate, and that her chronic disability since a previous auto accident made it unlikely that she would ever be returned to useful function. an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on 4 / 23 / 92 and revealed portal hypertension gastropathy, and grade 4 varices of the esophagus. meanwhile, she began to diuresis effectively on oral antibiotics, and intravenous antibiotics were discontinued after ten days and repeat paracentesis performed with only 320 white cells, with no preponderance of polys. the patient was difficult to mobilize, and required the assistance of her family as her diuresis progressed, eventually the diuretic program had to be reduced because of a drop in her weight, associated with nausea and weakness, with her weight eventually falling down to 123 pounds. at the time of maximum diuresis, she developed lethargy, and cramping of her extremities, and the diuretics had to be temporarily discontinued, and an optimum weight was finally decided upon, that was felt to be between 126 and 128. this period of time there was a brief increase in her sgot from the 100 ' s to 230. she was discharged home on 5 / 5 / 92 on the following program. 1600 calorie ada diet. no free water, no added salt, 60 gram protein diet.

revealed mesenteric adenopathy, normal bowels, hepatosplenomegaly, and? fatty liver. chest x - ray revealed early interstitial edema. hospital course : the patient was admitted with the diagnosis of cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock, hepatic failure, pancreatitis, and thrombocytopenia in the setting of cocaine intoxication. he was accepted at the vo yd burgsygu hospital center intensive care unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems. 1 - rhabdomyolysis. the patient had massive cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis. this resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia. the patient ' s creatinine _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ kinase peaked at 56, 160 with negative mb percentages. the aldolase was positive at 142. this was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities. the patient ' s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion. the patient ' s urine output was further augmented by adding dopamine. nevertheless, the patient ' s renal failure continued to progress. over the course of the hospitalization his ck fell in the serum. much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis. 2 - renal failure. the creatinine was 4. 4 on admission and peaked at 10. 5 on the 15th. the urinalysis revealed 4 + album", "4": "##in with marked occult blood. peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4 / 11 after a tenckhoff catheter was placed by drs. freierm, le, and round. subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10. he continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization. 3 - disseminated intravascular coagulation. on admission the patient ' s prothrombin time was 27. 7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d - dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69. he went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage. the patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets, and packed red blood cells. his dic was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent. 4 - septic shock. the patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization. he was maintained variously on levophed, dobutamine, dopamine, and ultimately epinephrine for blood pressure support. hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output. he had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses, lungs, and multiple lines. this will be discussed below. further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure. an echocardiogram on 4 / 12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations. his ejection fraction was 55 %. on 4 / 16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8, cardiac index of 4. 5, and an svr of 5. 8. 5 - hepatic failure. his sgpt on admission was 2, 520 with a peak at 7, 680 on hospital day two. he had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time. he was seen in consultation by the gi service and the liver transplantation service. given his multiple other medical problems, the direness of his situation, and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation.", "5": "6 - cocaine intoxication. serum cocaine was positive 6 - 12 hours ingestion at the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital. further, at ceanotsit ortgold center his serum toxicology screens were positive. this is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure. 7 - pneumonia. the patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms. the first was acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus, treated with ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. he subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with vancomycin, dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure. he was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily. 8 - pancreatitis. the amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161. although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements. 9 - catheter tip infections. the patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension. these were treated with vancomycin. 10 - anemia. the patient ' s hematocrit was 33 % on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization. 11 - coma. the patient, although initially minimally responsive, went on to develop a deep comatose state. a ct scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis. the lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient ' s persistent coagulopathy. the patient was treated empirically with nafcillin and ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis. further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy. despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive. mid - way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi - organ system failure syndrome. the patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization. nevertheless, he developed refractory hypoxemia, hypotension", "6": ", and ultimately the patient died despite total life support. discharge diagnosis : cocaine intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, septic shock, hepatic failure, pneumonia, pancreatitis, catheter tip infection, anemia, coma. principal procedure : peritoneal dialysis catheter placement, peritoneal dialysis, arterial catheterization, venous catheterization, continuous mechanical ventilation, and parenteral nutrition. complications during admission : neck hematoma secondary to pulmonary artery line placement requiring transfusion, catheter tip infection. medications on discharge : none. condition on discharge : the patient was

at 263, 000. albumin 2. 5. hospital course : # 1. cerebrovascular accident. the patient suffered some mild weakness which", "2": "was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery. this was determined by head ct, head mri, head mra, carotid noninvasive studies, transcranial dopplers. the possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and holter monitor. her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function, a patent foramen ovale, with a trace right to left shunt, as determined by bubble study, trace mr was present. previous echoes have shown mvp at the ona hospital. her holter showed up to 12 beats of svt, but was otherwise unremarkable. the patient had a normal b12, negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization. she was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days coumadin was started. her exact coumadin dose is undetermined at this point, however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day. her pro time and ptt have normalized at the time of discharge. she needs to be given 5 mg of coumadin tonight, 5 / 22 / 92. in addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour. it is discontinued at the time of transport. the patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete. during evaluation of her neurologic status, it was determined that for several months prior to admission, the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate. on our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia, especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown. there are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen. at the time we were to embark on this evaluation, the patient ' s family strongly requested that she be transferred to the sas general hospital. what follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia. her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function, though this is not certain. moreover her mri did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions. our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome, relating to her history of breast ca. as i mentioned above, her", "3": "evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time. while mammogram and ca - 15. 3 and breast exam are all normal, the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast ca has reared its head. two possible markers are anti - hu syndrome and anti - yo antibody. these tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge. the results can be obtained by paging me, do a. joasscchird, m. d. at 834 - 364 - 2251. i will be happy to furnish the results. the patient has a history of mi in 1989. echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities. ekg, when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral q / wave inversion. we would like to discontinue her isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension, but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this. persantine thallium is scheduled at this time, but is yet to be performed. the patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years. it has been evaluated in the past without success. during her hospitalization, we confirmed the presence of this, even when she was hydrated with saline, to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2 %. studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia. studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her rr interval evaluation was not abnormal. this is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk. florinef is to be considered, however stopping the isordil is one goal. the patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia. in addition there is a distant history of m. kansasaii infection. this has been evaluated by dr. screen at sas general hospital and probably relates to her lung xray. ct at the ona hospital in 1989 showed similar findings. a chest ct was to be performed and may be yielding. a ppd was placed and is to be read on saturday, 4 26th. the left volar forearm has the ppd just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa", "4": ". the patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990, for which she received 6 months of coumadin. dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission. it is doubtful that she has chronic pe, but this is one consideration. it is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease, and so this is a consideration. the patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131. we think this is likely due to an siadh as she is euvolemic. this can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time. the patient has glaucoma. her medications are as listed below. her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer. his name is ettrent can and he can be

evidence for deep venous thrombosis bilaterally. hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital preoperative exam. his total estimated blood loss for the operation was 3, 070 cc, of which 1, 970 cc was weighed on the sponges, 700 cc was in the suction, and 400 cc was estimated from the fields. for replacement he received 500 cc of autologous packed cells, 2, 250 cc of albumen and 2400 cc of lactated ringer solutions. in the recovery room his hemivac drained 350 cc over 4 hours. his labs in the recovery room showed a white blood count of 9. 9, hematocrit 29. 5, and a platelet count of 183, 000. his prothrombin", "4": "time was 11. 3, and partial thromboplastin time of 31. 4. electrocardiogram showed some intermittent premature ventricular contractions and st wave changes. he was transferred an additional unit of autologous packed cells in the recovery room and an additional unit of autologous blood was hung to be transfused on the floor. over the next 24 hours, his hemivac drain put out small amounts of serous sanguinous fluid, and was removed without difficulty. he was transfused 1 additional unit of banked blood the evening of surgery. he underwent serial hematocrit determinations throughout the rest of the hospital stay. on postoperative day 1, his hematocrit was 29. 1, the next day it was 26. 5. on 12 / 19, his hematocrit stabilized at 29. 6, and he received no additional transfusion. for management of pain postoperatively, he was placed on the pca morphine pump. this provided excellent relief of his incisional pain. he was gradually weaned off the intravenous morphine, and switched over to oral analgesics with good control of his pain. prior to discharge, he was switched over to percocet, which provided excellent relief of his pain, and he was discharged with a prescription for percocet. postoperatively, he was placed in balance suspension, and kept at bedrest for two days when he was then mobilized, and started gait training, using a walker, and then crutches. prior to discharge, he was independent in ambulation with crutches, as well as transfers. with the history of electrocardiogram changes in the recovery room, the patient was seen in consult by dr. lako head, of cardiology. dr. head found the at the electrocardiogram was consistent, but not diagnostic with mild ischemia. the patient has had no prior history of coronary artery disease, and the absence of significant st depressions, he found the findings of only mild concern. patient was placed on nitropace 1 / 2 \" q6h. he was placed on the cardiac monitor for 36 hours, and had cpk isoenzyme determinations. the patient ' s electrocardiogram returned to normal, he had no evidence or episodes, of ischemia or chest pain, in the perioperative, his", "5": "cpk and isoenzymes showed no evidence of myocardial infarction. nitropace was discontinued on 12 / 17 / 92, and the patient was cleared by dr. head, and no further cardiology followup was required. mr. head '

for staple removal. the staples were removed, and steri strips were applied. the wound was found healing by primary intention, without evidence for infection. for prophylaxis against infection mr. head was placed on ancef perioperatively. this was continued for 72 hours postoperatively. for prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis, he was placed on coumadin perioperatively. his daily dosage was adjusted according to his prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. on postoperative day number 2 his prothrombin time was 13. 3, and partial thromboplastin time was 39. 0, and he received 5 mg of coumadin. on postoperative day 3, his prothrombin time was 14. 9, and his partial thromboplastin time was 40. 6, and he received 4 mg of coumadin. on 12 / 20 / 92, he underwent bilateral venous ultrasound of the lower extremities. this was negative for deep venous thrombosis bilaterally. his coumadin was discontinued. mr. head required intermittent straight cath for the first 48 hours postoperatively. urine was sent for urinalysis, and culture and sensitivity, with this straight catheterization, and the urine culture and the urinalysis were negative. he was continued on intravenous ancef for a total of 72 hours postoperatively, to cover him for the intermittent catheterizations. about 36 hours postoperatively, the patient was able to void spontaneously, and there no further intermittent catheterizations were required. mr. head continued to progress well with his physical therapy. prior to discharge he was ambulating independently with crutches, and on stairs, and was

that the patient be heparinized as the scabeth t hospital surgery team had already done and that coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization. these recommendations were already underway. consequently we simply continued our management. the cardiology consult also spoke to the patient ' s primary medical doctor, dr. blood in clear la who related that the patient had had two", "2": "large esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia vera in the past. on 5 - 30 - 92 the patient ' s gastroenterologist dr. ri blood was contacted. dr. blood was on vacation, however dr. kotethorereke, his partner was in the office and went through mr. flytheleungfyfe ' s old chart and noted that dr. blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his north

injection. follow up endoscopy on mar 15, 1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in january. there was also a 4 cm. hiatus hernia from 36 cm. to 40 cm. the stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal. from dr. blood ' s standpoint on mar 15, 1992 there was no contraindication to coumadinization. we discussed coumadinization with dr. blood and noting dr. blood ' s earlier findings we, in conjunction with dr. blood decided to coumadinize the patient and coumadinization was begun on 5 - 30 - 92. it was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q. day. that was concurrent with albuterol 150 mg. po q. day. given the patient ' s history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5 - 31 - 92. the findings were as follows. the principal operating surgeon was dr. ca scgach with the assistance of dr. jesclinke. the principal findings were a 5. 0 cm. hiatal hernia and apparent ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center ' s esophagus distally. in the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities. there were no abnormalities into", "3": "the second portion of the duodenum. the overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer, a hiatus hernia, an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a barrett ' s esophagus. no biopsy was taken. the biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure. on 6 - 1 - 92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite. findings were : there was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus, although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus. there was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation. there was focal calcification in the mitral annulus. the aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis. there was trace aortic insufficiency. the aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters. the left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection fractio n of 57 percent. there was trace tricuspid insufficiency. there was evidence of an old pacer wire in the right atrium. there was trace pulmonary insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters. there was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block. the patient, it should be noted at this time, was doing very well and he was taking regular diet, voiding spontaneously. he had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6 - 2 - 92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate. on 6 - 2 - 92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain. he confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently rheumatology consult was obtained. the rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint. joint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals, that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo - gout. joint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6 - 4 - 92. the rheumato", "4": "##logist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification. a wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo - gout. the patient ' s pseudogout was treated with colchicine 0. 6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time

consequently his heparin was discontinued. today his prothrombin time is 16. 7 and it looks like 5 mg. of coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him. consequently, he is ready for discharge today. the only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with coumadin his ecotrin has been discontinued. medications on discharge : isordil 10 mg. po t. i. d. ditropan 5 mg. po q.

ray. she was started on nebulizers around - the - clock and chest physical therapy. sputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism. on the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement. her urinary output remained good at 80 - 100 ccs. per hour. however, her bun and creatinine remained elevated. on 6 / 5 / 94 they were 21 and 2. 2 respectively. her coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an i and r of 2. 5 -

oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped. an electroencephalogram was requested and was negative. no computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed. she continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs", "4": ". for 24 hours. off her ifex the patient ' s sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted. for this reason a barium study was performed on 6 / 12 / 94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum. the mucosa appeared to be preserved. in addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon. the patient ' s white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6 / 11 / 94 and nadired down to 0. 7 on 6 / 12 / 94. the patient was placed on neutropenic precautions, her intravenous antibiotics were continued. her sensorium had cleared. because of persistent nausea and vomiting on june 13, 1994 a kub and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter. the patient ' s white blood count persisted in the region of. 5 to. 6 with an anc of 60 for the next two to three days. in addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6 / 13 / 94. she was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and gcsf therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia. despite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused. a gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6 / 14 / 94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting. on conservative therapy the patient ' s nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided. a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( peg ) tube was placed on june 18, 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting. on 6 / 17 / 94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25, the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells, white count however had increased to 8. 5 and her platelets were on their way up, count was 74, 000. and she was not given platelets in addition. throughout this period the patient ' s pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia. after much discussion with the family and social services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable. on august 21, 1994 a picc line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia", "5": "( pca ) and on 6 / 23 / 94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x -

was 40, liver enzymes normal range. hospital course : the patient was taken to the intensive care unit after her angiogram. she was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin. a small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram, was without sequelae. she was doing well with at least 4 + strength in all of her extremities, when on 11 /", "2": "13, she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis. this was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function. for a short time, she seemed \" locked in

right wrist and hand. 4 - to 4 + strength at the left ankle, 4 + strength at the right knee and right ankle. she is unable to lift either foot off the bed. the extra ocular movements are full. tongue protrudes 4 cm. she is drowsy at times, but generally alert, responsive, interactive, able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to. she has severe memory deficits, but nevertheless, is able to engage in conversation, answers questions, names things well, does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences. she has been working with speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement. she is anticoagulated on coumadin and this has been stable. she is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members. follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis, mid brain, the superior cerebellar areas, left thalamus, bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery. the patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts. a chest x - ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate. initially this improved on clindamycin and cefotetan, but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen. sputum grew out klebsiella pneumoniae, and she was treated with gentamicin and ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ). a left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance, and found to be sterile, and without evidence of empyema. the patient is on ciprofloxacin. the day of discharge is day # 3 of 7, after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued. she has developed bad thrush in this setting,", "3": "she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on nystatin swish and spit five times a day. she also gets peridex to clean out her mouth. once her liver enzymes are completely normal, a seven day course of fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics. she has been afebrile for greater than 10 days, including several days on oral antibiotics. the patient ' s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course, to about three times normal, especially the sgot and sgpt. these have spontaneously reversed, and are nearly normal at the time of discharge. a right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones, without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis. the exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear, but we are being careful about administering drugs, which might irritate the liver. the patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization. iron studies are all entirely normal, her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies. the plan is to give her folic acid, but not iron. the patient ' s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion. this is thought due to the extensive course of gentamicin which she received. this must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium. the patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization. this may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process, with fluids administered as described, she should not have any problems from this. her sodiums were never below 130. she does well with tube feeds. her tube feeds orders are as follow : full strength replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour. in addition, the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day. she also gets lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds. she also gets metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day. please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist, showed that the patient is aspirating at this time, but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon. it is for this reason that she is", "4": "discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for g tube placement are made at this time. she has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up. she did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes. in the first week of november, her electrocardiogram showed t wave inversions in the lateral leads, correlating with an increase in the ldh, but not ck. this did not normalize with administration of isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time. as of 4 / 7, her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes, and chest pain is absent. her cholesterol was 350 here. she has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines. these can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable, in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes. note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission,

2 cm below the right costal margin, but smooth and nontender. there was no splenomegaly. the femoral pulses were diminished. he had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae. the extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. the pulses were 1 + bilaterally. the skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo. the rectal examination was guaiac negative. laboratory data : the laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes, bun and creatinine, normal liver function tests, a first cpk of 140, and a hematocrit of 43. 1. the portable chest x - ray showed

myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes. on 10 - 27 - 93, the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions, a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been ptca ' d, a lesion in the first om, and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the om3. the left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle. given the results of this cardiac catheterization, which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the ptca, it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient. he was ambulated progressively on the floor. a beta blocker was started with metoprolol initially at 25 mg po bid and eventually increased to 50 mg po bid. the patient ambulated extensively on the fih 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath. on 11 - 2 - 93, the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with thallium imaging. this treadmill test was done on medications, including beta blockers, in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment. the patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified bruce protocol, however, he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade. there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test, although he did have 0. 5 to 1 mm st depression in ii, iii, and avf. the study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain. thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle. there was", "4": "also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test. these images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous thallium images in may 1993. after extensive discussion between myself, dr. amesin, and dr. scgach, it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management. the patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery, although he understands that this may become necessary in the future. dr. amesin had a long discussion with the patient ' s daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient ' s compliance. previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments. the importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient. she will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with dr. amesin as well as dr. lfsquarc on the outside. the patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization. despite being on heparin for a short time, his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization

recurrent chest pain. an echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44 %. on transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool. he was evaluated by the gi service who felt that, given the patient ' s course, he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future. the patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day. he exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds, achieving 80 % of the maximal heart rate on the modified bruce protocol. he did not have

admission to the intensive care unit on august 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds", "4": "were held. she was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the intensive care unit. at the end of this time, she was begun gradually on g tube feeding, however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates. this problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital. she is currently being supported on tube feeds of vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly. she has also been supplemented with glutamine 10 grams b. i. d. via the g tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse. ms. abreun, from the onset of her stay at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests. these values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal. stone was demonstrated in the gallbladder, but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal. 5 ' nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180. to date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 ' nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative. further evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient. 6. infectious disease : ms. abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course. she ruled out by ppd. the initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with imipenem, flagyl and vancomycin. because of the extent of her wound, she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection. the course of flagyl, imipenem and vancomycin was continued for fourteen days. at this time imipenem were discontinued and vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days. she then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of august 29th. on admission to", "5": "the unit, she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with levo / vanc / flagyl. shortly thereafter gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to vancomycin, levofloxacin alone. after a ten day course of levofloxacin it was discontinued, vancomycin was maintained for five additional days, after which time, it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics. on discharge, she was currently taking no antibiotics. ms. abreun entered the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes. because of the stress of her infection and intensive care unit admission she was requiring sliding scale insulin for the full course of her hospital stay. her total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with insulin nph for better control. her total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units nph q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars. ms. abreun ' s hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital. her thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a synthroid dose of 0. 125 milligrams for the majority of her stay. at the time of her admission to the intensive care unit on august 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26. 83. more active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to. 3 milligrams q day, which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately. she has since been maintained on a dose of 0. 2 milligrams iv q d. however, she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6. 68. her discharge medication will include synthroid dose of 0. 3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely. in summary : ms. abreun is a fifty nine - year - old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip, status post debridement, severely debilitated by the extent of her infection. over the course of 2 months this infection was cleared, the wound", "6": "was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound. her course, however was complicated by an methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required intensive care unit support for a period of a week. her course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period, but has since resolved with aggressive synthroid therapy. currently, her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her po intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated. her wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non -

hemoglobin of 5. 0. he received five units of blood. a bone marrow biopsy was done on january 8, 1998 by dr. iron in drive, jerryworthi. the bone marrow biopsy was nondiagnostic, but the aspirate was tested for myelodysplasia. he was treated thereafter with transfusions of two units approximately every two to three weeks. a second biopsy in february, 1998 was even less revealing. the aspirate was suggestive of involvement by lymphoma, but the bone marrow biopsy was felt to be related to myeloid leukemia. a third bone marrow biopsy was done on march 7, 1998, at santusli hospital which showed cd 35 positive, hla - d positive undifferentiated acute leukemia. therefore, the patient was admitted for treatment induction chemotherapy based on an all type regimen for this acute undifferentiated leukemia. past medical history : cad status post ptca stent because of ett positive on march 5, 1998, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia. allergies : no known drug allergies. medications on admission

illness : riie pruesschird is a 25 year - old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from nacalv medical center with a fever to 101, vomiting times one and \" left kidney pain \". this patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of dep therapy for pulmonary involvement. in the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ - cell transformation. in early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in february of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and adriamycin for six cycles. in 05 / 99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis. in early 2000 he was started on therapy with taxol per dr. azel hibbskays and finished this in march of this year. ct imaging at that time was negative for disease. in april of this year, he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side. thereafter he began chemotherapy with taxotere in 05 / 13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06 / 14 / 00. most recently he has had problems with nausea, vomiting, fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the pointexasp region general hospital on 06 / 16 / 00. that hospital course was sign for hydration, antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly, tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus. he", "1": "was treated with intra - arterial thrombolysis ( tpa ) and was discharged on 06 / 28 / 00 on high dose, low molecular weight heparin. it was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot, certainly this could have been tumor embolization. finally, the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to pre health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans, not to be resuscitated in the event of a life - threatening situation. mr. pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101, last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea, vomiting times one earlier today. as well he has complained of some vague left abdominal / flank pain that he attributes to \" kidney pain \". he was given flagyl and had already apparently been on levofloxacin at the outside hospital since his recent discharge for questionable pneumonia. mr. pruesschird denies headaches, chest pain and any change in his breathing or comfort with breathing. he denies persistent vomiting, abdominal pain, other than as mentioned, new skin changes or diarrhea. there is no joint swelling or tenderness. he otherwise feels about the same as when he left the hospital recently except for his left abdominal flank pain. past medical history : essentially

advancement flap. right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap. primary closure of wound. history and reason for hospitalization : the patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection. at that time the patient ' s hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap. the patient was then continued by report on dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation. the patient apparently did well until june 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area. a ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired. the patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired. however the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma. by report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital. however the patient was then subsequently transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital upon request of the family on 8 / 24 / 98 for further evaluation and possible intervention. the patient was evaluated by dr. rhalt of dentvailr. medical center. as the patient ' s early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels. there was no evidence for a definite", "1": "leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process. at the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who upon culturing the patient ' s sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous unasyn to levofloxacin for what appeared to be citrobacter and diphtheroids in the wound cultures. subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient ' s wound drainage appeared to subside. given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient ' s only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure. the patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed. the patient otherwise complained of no angina, no shortness of breath, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no edema, no palpitations or symptoms of syncope. he did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months. past medical history : 1. thoracic aneurysm repair. 2. hypertension. 3. status post hernia repair. medications on admission : 1. lopressor 100 mg po three times a day. 2. captopril 75 mg po three times a day. 3. prilosec 20 mg po per day. 4. hydralazine 12. 5 mg four times per day. 5. reglan 10 mg po three times

afebrile, vital signs were stable. head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam : negative. neck was supple. there was no jugular venous distention. 2 + carotids without bruits. cardiovascular exam : regular rate and rhythm with a 2 / 6 diastolic _ _ _ and a 1 / 6 systolic ejection murmur. his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles. extremities : the", "2": "patient had 2 + femoral pulses and 1 + pedal pulses. laboratory and radiologic data : sodium 137, potassium 4. 0, blood urea nitrogen 16, creatinine. 9, white blood cell count 4. 9, hematocrit 29. 7, platelet count 207. the patient ' s preoperative chest x - ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. physical examination : the patient ' s sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed. hospital course : the patient was initially admitted to the cardiac surgical service under dr. rhalt. the patient was admitted to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit given the patient ' s precarious condition. over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier. the patient was also seen in consultation by the infectious disease service as well as the cardiology service who assisted in managing the patient ' s intermittent hypertension. the patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the plastic surgical service for potential sternal reconstruction. after lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient ' s family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft. this was obtained on 08 / 30 / 98 by dr. niste rhalt of the cardiac surgical service. the patient was then subsequently taken to the operating room on 08 / 31 / 98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection. the procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest. the aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein. the cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes. the graft used was a homograft. the patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit with his chest open. the immediate postoperative plans were for a short intensive care unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient ' s sternum. the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit in stable condition. there he continued to be hemodynamically stable. of note, intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent. in the intensive", "3": "care unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09 / 02 / 98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement. on that day the plastic surgical service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient ' s sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound. the patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. a number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps. the patient was then transferred back to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit in stable condition. at this point the patient continued to followed by infectious disease service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included vancomycin and levofloxacin. the operating room cultures at that point were positive for crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters. over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties. the patient ' s subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including lopressor 100 mg po three times a day, captopril 100 mg po three times a day, as well as procardia. the patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control. subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the intensive care unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the cardiac surgical inpatient service. the patient continued to be followed by the infectious disease service who felt that the patient ' s jackson pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them. as per the infectious disease service the patient was continued on levofloxacin, vancomycin as antibiotic coverage. however on 09 / 08 / 98 the infectious disease service was made aware that the patient ' s intraoperative cultures had also grown out mycoplasma humilius. given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of vancomycin and then subsequent levofloxacin for the citrobacter and", "4": "mycoplasma as well. the patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics. this was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty. at the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen. he was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well. he continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable. on postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the pip joint of his left middle finger. subsequent hand x - rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the plastic surgery hand service. the patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint. the patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the plastic surgical service who discontinued a number of the patient ' s indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation. these drains will then be subsequently taken out by dr. general upon his followup with the patient. prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics. the patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress. as a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation. the patient ' s condition continued to be improved. given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09 / 13 / 1998. in consultation with the infectious disease service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics. condition on discharge : good. discharge instructions : diet : high calorie, high protein. the patient ' s treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks. the patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by occupational therapy services fairm of ijordcompmac hospital. the patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger. the patient on discharge is to have twice weekly vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term vancomycin therapy. the patient was instructed to return to fairm", "5": "of ijordcompmac hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema, drainage, or increasing incisional pain. the patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills. medications on discharge : 1. vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h. 2. levofloxacin 500 mg po per day. 3. prilosec 20 mg po per day. 4. captopril 100 mg po three

: the patient was instructed that he needed to followup with dr. rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763 - 6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in oaksale lavalle. the patient was also instructed to followup with dr. both of the cardiology service fairm of ijordcompmac hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted. the patient will also be seen in followup by dr. chpo e. enla general of the plastic surgery service fairm of ijordcompmac hospital so that his indwelling jackson pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him. the patient will also be followed by the infectious disease service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy. the patient was instructed to followup with dr. naco mesprhalt of the infectious disease service by calling her office for an appointment at 094 - 902 - 2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient ' s discharge. dr. dau ' s recommendation is that the patient is to stay on vancomycin and levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression. ryna dau, m. d. dictating for : niste ma rhalt, m. d. tr : oq dd : 09 / 13 / 1998 td : 09 / 13 / 1998 7 : 18 a cc : kend n both, m", "6": ".

throughout her hospital course, however on july 12, 1998, after starting dialysis ( see below ), the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen. repeat chest x - rays and chest ct scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually, the patient ' s pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks. at the time of her discharge, the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90 %. 2 ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura : the patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28, hematocrit of 32, ldh of 496 with 2 + schistocytes and 2 + spherocytes on her smear. this was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on june 20, 1998, she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through july 27, 1999. she was also changed to intravenous solu - medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of prednisone prior to discharge. her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on july 3, 1998, then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on july 20, 1999. her ldh which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s, but remained elevated. she continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear, but it was much decreased. the patient also required red blood cell transfusions, approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit. eventually, her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after july 27, 1999. after this, the patient ' s", "3": "platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge. it is felt that the patient ' s thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved. she will continue on her prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper. 3 ) renal : the patient presented in acute renal failure with a bun of 101 and a creatinine of 3. 7. throughout the month of june, she had a rising potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on july 12, 1998. the opinion of the renal consult was that this was permanent and non - reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week. she required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload. during the course of her dialysis, she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation. 4 ) infectious disease : the patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on june 23, 1998, july 4, 1998, july 8, 1998 and july 9, 1998. the patient eventually had a left subclavian tesio catheter placed and a right brachial picc line placed on july 10, 1998 which remained patent and uninfected. she received a full three week course of vancomycin and also received a three week course of ceftazidime. in addition, she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with amphojel bladder irrigation, which was followed by a klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received levofloxacin times fourteen days. she also received a fourteen day course of acyclovir which was begun on june 21, 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus. she was also on fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days. the patient was also started on bactrim one double strength tablet q. o. d. as prophylaxis for p", "4": "##neumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids. 5 ) rheumatology : the patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ana of 1 : 640 although her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative. unfortunately throughout her admission, we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange. a repeat ana, rheumatoid factor and anca may be repeated as an outpatient. follow - up : 1 ) the patient will follow - up with her primary care physician, dr. tamarg study, in arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation. 2 ) the patient is being discharged to a hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on monday, wednesday and friday. the nephrologist who will follow her there is dr. study. 3 ) the patient will continue to have her cbc, ldh, bilirubin, chem - 7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to dr. ian zineisfreierm, the hematology attending at fax number 751 - 329 - 8840. 4 ) the patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula. the left subclavian tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time. she would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at pre health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this. 5 ) the patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26. 6 ) the patient will continue her prednisone at 40 mg p. o. q. day times one month ( this was started on july 27, 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by pulmonary. 7 ) the patient has a follow - up appointment in the pulmonary clinic with dr. cedwi stone at 336 - 2931 on august 30, 1999 at 1 : 40 pm. 8 ) the patient has a follow - up appointment with dr. ian zineisfreierm at the we erthunt hospital at 180 - 0455 on august 15, 1999 at 12 : 30 pm. medications on discharge : 1 ) calcitriol 0", "5": ". 25

brought to the haold memorial hospital emergency room and was found to have a pulse of 61 and blood pressure of 91 / 45. the electrocardiogram done there showed evidence of an inferior wall infarction with st segment elevations in leads 2, 3 and avf and st depressions in leads v1 through v4 and avl. right sided leads did not provide evidence of a right ventricular infarction. she was given

bundle branch block and continued st segment elevation with qs in 3 and avf. she was admitted to the coronary care unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia. she became increasingly disoriented. she developed first degree av block and then wenckebach block. the chest films showed mild cephalization. she became very drowsy with sedation when", "2": "she developed some agitation and required intubation. she went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock. she had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2. 3. catheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease. the right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2. 5 stent was placed with good result. she had timi 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery. she continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia. she remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat. dobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation. she was initially tried on intravenous pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm. she was later switched to amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation. eventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor. she had a lot of wheezing and in late january she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3. 2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure. she was then returned to the unit where she underwent further monitoring. the bun rose to 91. her digoxin level was 1. 9 on february 6. she was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor. efforts to mobilize her began in early january and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49 %. the right ventricular function was normal. after extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with decadron. the patient was seen in consultation by ent consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords, glottic inlet and subglottis. there was no structural abnormality. moistened oxygen and mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor. she continued a rather slow improvement. the patient was seen in consultation by drs. morning and morning because of the", "3": "abnormalities of renal function. the possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a mri. she had some hematuria and was seen by dr. ryna jescdrig. renal and bladder ultrasounds were normal. she had abnormal urinary cytology however and dr. jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that. that can take place either here at his office or in aersing rocuch sun or when she returns to carfachemoses hospital. because of alternating and fluctuating mental status, she had a head ct scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding. this was followed up and was shown to resolve. mr angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis. a mri of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous. she was then begun on coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on carfachemoses hospital.

13 / 2000 principal diagnosis : metastatic melanoma. principal procedure : wide resection of metastatic melanoma to the right shoulder with partial thickness skin graft reconstruction on 9 / 1 / 00. history of present illness : this is a 69 year old man who was initially diagnosed with a right upper posterior extremity melanoma level 4, 2. 5 mm in depth, in 10 / 02 / 92. subsequently in 10 / 92 he underwent a wide excision with axillary dissection which showed residual malignant melanoma with nine negative lymph nodes. he had a recurrence in 05 / 99 in a similar area which was 2. 1 mm in thickness. he had this resected between 8 / 4 and 9 / 5 / 97 and was treated with 6000 c of radiation therapy over the right upper extremity. he has done well since that time and subsequently in 05 / 98 had pulmonary nodules which were noted and a computer tomogram scan in 08 / 98 demonstrated a 4. 2 cm splenic lesion. he underwent an open splenectomy in the fall 1998 which demonstrated metastatic melanoma only to the spleen. since that time he has been treated with _ _ _ _ _ _ _ cells in 1999 and also with allovecting injection to the right anterior axillary nodule. most recently in he has this right anterior axillary metastatic melanoma resected at brook hospital by dr. bainpruess on with local triceps myocutaneous tissue transfer. since april through july this area has increased in size where the triceps tissue transfer has been replaced with a bulky metastatic melanoma disease. surgical consultation for resection of this for local _ _ _ control was requested. the patient has _ _ _ dr. peakekudz and has known visceral metastases of the liver as well the lung with mediastinal adenopathy which has been stable for the past two years. the other complicating factor in his", "1": "care was that he was wheelchair bound from a viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1966 and has relied heavily on his upper extremity for wheelchair transfer and access and transportation. in order to workup up this metastatic melanoma recurrent after local excision only two months previously it was elected to get an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the shoulder. this magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed that there was a large mass which measured approximately 4 - 6cm anterior to the deltopectoral groove and unfortunately a smaller lesion 1cm was seen separately adjacent and medial to the biceps tendon near the brachial neurovascular bundle. an magnetic resonance imaging scan which was performed three months prior to admission to brook hospital for resection demonstrated that this more medial lesion was not present at that time and therefore it was suspicious for metastatic melanoma. the patient had a fine needle aspiration of this bulky tumor mass which demonstrated malignant melanoma and subsequently he was sent for a positron emission tomography scan which was performed at s nakantlakeing university hospital and medical center on 8 / 24 / 00. the positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a known larger anterior metastatic melanoma and more medially two approximately 1cm lesions that also enhanced. these were consistent with metastatic melanoma near the brachial plexus confirmed by the magnetic resonance imaging scan. the patient now presents for surgical resection and reconstructive repair of this lesion. past medical history : viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1996 which left him paralyzed from waist down and wheelchair bound. he is incontinent of bowel and bladder and wears a texas catheter due to phimosis of the penis. he also suffered comminuted fractures of the right lower extremity. he has bilateral venous stasis and hypertension. past surgical history : as above including a splenectomy. medications on admission : 1. atenolol 25 mg po per day. allergies : bactrim. sulfa. intravenous pyelogram dye. social history : he works as a lawyer. he is active in general practice and is divorced with four daughter one of

physical examination : afebrile, vital signs stable. his right shoulder had a large 6cm bulky mass which had grown somewhat in size over the past 2 - 3 weeks. the bulky mass is somewhat mobile on the medial aspect and there are subcutaneous nodules which had not been present before. the axillary area medially has two dominant nodules. hospital course : the patient underwent a wide excision of the

university medical center admissions for this 74 - year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench jones proteinuria over one year ago. there were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with prednisone. she had a partial response, but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin. the patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time, namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency. the weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking. her appetite was gone. she was having some nausea. no recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them. no changes in her breathing. she did not seem sleepy or confused. physical examination : blood pressure 130 / 40, heart rate 78 regular. weight 132, ( had been 126 one year previously ). temperature 97. the patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities. she could walk hesitantly for a few steps, was anicteric, lucid, not tachypneic. she has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues", "1": "about somatic distress when she has some. her lungs were clear. heart ; without murmur or gallop. her jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water, carotid upstrokes normal. soft, non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds. no hepatosplenomegaly or masses. she had 2 + edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema. she was moving all four extremities. her cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection. laboratory data on admission : hematocrit 24. 6, white count 4. 0, platelet count 170, 000, normal differential, sodium 143, potassium 5. 7, chloride 113, carbon dioxide 18. 9, bun and creatinine 71 / 5. 2, glucose 177. hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to the ponta, itri - university medical center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal, a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium k - exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits. over the following days, she was gently hydrated. her urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5. 8. she was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney. in the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma. she tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission. the patient, her son randdor so and i had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis. the family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable. they did agree, however to one more attempt at pulse decadron therapy with consists of oral decadron forty mgs po q. day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off, followed by four days on, etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of decadron", "2": "on. by the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300 ' s or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of nph. on the days when she was not on decadron the standing doses of nph were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting, perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes. there had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4. 7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload. potassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization. she was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years, not progressive, minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that i discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak. the problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes + / - her myeloma. the patient also requested to be do not resuscitate, do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son so. the patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more, although probably not come back to normal. she will finish her last planned pulse of decadron by about november 25, 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments. medications on discharge : 1. heparin 5000 units subq b. i. d. 2. clonazepam 0. 5 mgs po q. h. s. 3. risperidone 3 mgs po q. h. s. 4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders, but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than", "3": "200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subq, 251 to 300 give six units subq, from 301 to 350 give eight units subq, from 351 to 400 give ten units subq, and if over 400 give twelve units subq. she also has standing doses of insulin nph ten in the morning, ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without decadron. 5. metoprolol titrate 12. 5 mgs po b. i. d. 6. calcium acetate ( phos -

flow and two stents needed to be placed, as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending. the distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber. a good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the intensive care unit on a balloon pump, intubated. his peak cpk was in the 3000 range. the patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on integrelin and heparin. he", "2": "underwent bronchoscopy, which showed no specific lesion. in addition, chest ct showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis, with the exception of atelectasis. it was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration, which predisposed him to hemoptysis. in addition, the patient had confusion and delirium. head ct was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe. he was seen in consultation by the neurology and psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of seroquel and haldol. in addition, the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented. the patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2 / 2 / 02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex. this was uneventful, without the need for intubation, etc, and the procedure went smoothly. he tolerated it well. the ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission. the patient was transferred to evinlandcalco hospital. he had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post -

aortic balloon pump. central access was gained and a chest x - ray was done which showed no pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as ng tube. he was still in some chf, mild to moderate. atropine one amp was given. at this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change. there was a question of fleeting t waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead ekg. at this time 1 mg of glucagon iv was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture. at this point, the blood pressure continued to fall and", "4": "the patient was no longer responsive. the rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9 : 18 p. m. the patient was without respirations or blood pressure. the family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called. autopsy was requested, however, the patient ' s family will not give us their decision until tomorrow morning. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ qa963 / 6125 ieta care, m. d. ug0 d : 12 / 23 / 90 batch : 6826 report : j5825m4 t : 12 / 26 / 90 dictated by : chpo care, m. d.

grafting procedure in march, 1990, following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction. he had a very stormy course, dominated by post infarction angina pectoris, high grade atrial ventricular block, gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, and no noliguric renal failure. an intra - aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization. he also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30, and a calculated valve area of 1. 2 cm squared. despite the magnitude of these problems, he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months, and was able to return to work on a part - time basis, after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation. postoperatively, we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40 %, by gated cardiac blood pool scanning. over these past 3 years, he has remained stable, on a very simple program of aspirin, and atenolol. he returned for routine office evaluation on 3 / 25 / 93, complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea, with occasional chest discomfort, and, more recently, orthopnea, cough, peripheral edema, and weight gain. physical examination : weight 197 lbs, up 6 lbs, blood pressure 128 / 88, heart rate 70 and regular. the venous pressure was markedly elevated", "1": "to 15 cm. the carotids were of low volume, and sluggish bilaterally, with transmission of a basal heart murmur. there was dullness at both bases, with rales 1 / 3 way upon the right, and at the base on the left. the right ventricle, and left ventricle impulses were diffuse. there was a grade i - ii murmur of aortic stenosis, with additional murmurs of tricuspid, and mitral regurgitation, and an obvious s3. the liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin, and there was 1 - 2 + peripheral edema. his chest x - ray demonstrated cardiomegaly, with bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and pulmonary vascular re - distribution. the electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree av block, an old inferior myocardial infarction, and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction, and non - specific st - t wave abnormalities, that were unchanged compared to june, 1992. later, an echocardiogram on 3 / 27 / 93, demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus, and incomplete closure of the valve, consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction. the left atrium was dilated to 52 mm. the aortic valve was thickened, with restrictive motion, and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets. there was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation, however, due to technical difficulties, accurate gradients could not be estimated. the left ventricle was dilated, with concentric hypertrophy, and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities, with a reduced ejection fraction of 24 %. there was also doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency. a persantine thallium scan on 3 / 31 / 93, showed increased lung uptake, cavity dilatation and a large inferior, apical scar, without evidence of active ischemia. laboratory data : potassium 4. 4, bun and creatinine 33 / 1. 7, albumen 3. 6, total bilirubin 1. 8, direct bilirubin 0. 5, ck 162, with 11. 1 m", "2": "##b for a relative index of 6. 9 %. this was of uncertain significance. the hematocrit 43. 2, whiteblood count 9. 2, prothrombin time 10. 4, partial thromboplastin time 34. 2, urinalysis had 1 + albumen and 0 - 2 white blood cells, per high power field, with a culture that demonstrated rare enterococcus. hospital course : the patient was admitted to the medical service, and placed at bed rest, and given intravenous furosemide. over the course of the next few days, we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs, to as low as 177 1 / 2 lbs. coincident with this, his clinical condition improved markedly, and he became fully ambulatory. given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred, we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4 / 1 / 93. at the time of this study, the right atrial pressure was 1, the pa pressure 32 / 10, and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10. there was a 40 - 50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve, a mean gradient of 40, and a calculated valve area of 0. 5 cm squared, using a cardiac output of 3. 4 liters per minute. left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation. there was mild mitral regurgitation, a posterior basil aneurysm, and akinesis of the apex, septum, and inferior walls. the anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic, and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic. the aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis. a dominant right coronary artery had an 80 % proximal stenosis, and was then occluded at the acute margin. a large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion. the posterior descending artery had an 80 % stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft. the left anterior descending was proximally occluded, and the left circumflex had a 90 % stenosis in the first marginal branch, and 90 % stenosis distally in other branches. the saphenous vein graft to the right ventric", "3": "##ular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff. the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis. the saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow. certainly, the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction. these findings were reviewed with dr. patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in mr. breun ' s management. his advanced age, prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction, together with his chronic renal insufficiency, would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement. percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty, on the other hand, would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics. it is very unlikely that we will offer mr. breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future. he seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him. he is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy. we will see how far we can get with medical therapy although mr. wierst and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis. ethelan kotefyfechird, m. d. tr : go / bmot dd

woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever. she was in her usual state of health until 6 / 15 / 93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion, diarrhea, and fevers up to 104, associated with chills. there were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness. she was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time. because of increasing mental status changes, the patient was admitted to o center in sondibrid ey on 6 / 20, and she was found to have a gram - positive urinary tract infection, high fever, and was started on ciprofloxacin. blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including clostridium perfringens, coagulase negative staph, and alpha hemolytic streptococcus. her antibiotics were appropriately", "1": "changed. at the family ' s request, the patient was transferred to heaonboburg linpack grant medical center for further evaluation. hospital course : further evaluation at heaonboburg linpack grant medical center, demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically. her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature. cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation, an enlarged left atrium, and good ventricular function. there was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation. she was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature, although some low grade temperatures initially persisted. the patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources. she was evaluated by the gynecology service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the gi service where she underwent a barium enema. there was no evidence of gi or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source. in addition, she was evaluated by the sileyer medical center and there was no evidence of active dental infection. she had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke. because of her complex picture, and because the source of her sepsis was not found, the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement, if indicated. her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation. towards the end of june, she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field. a rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized. on 7 / 13, she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation. she was moved to the intensive care unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery. her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess. after considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient ' s care, it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened. also, no source for sepsis had been found", "2": ". because of worsening mitral regurgitation, and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization, as well as elevated filling pressures, it was everyone ' s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics. accordingly, she was taken to the operating room on 7 / 21 / 93. during her cardiac procedure, she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta. she, therefore, underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement. her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided. it was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever. her valve was replaced with a st. jude medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely. she weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation, and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure. she was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy, and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis. in the early postoperative period, she had evidence

jakob disease, a dementia such as alzheimer ' s of a more rapidly progressing nature, and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source. work up included from a neurologic perspective brain mri, brain eeg, lumbar puncture. in concert with the neurology service,", "3": "who followed the patient with us, we ordered an eeg and mri with susceptibilities and dwi. an lumbar puncture was performed, in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14. 5 cm. in addition, per neurology recommendations, we sent cerebrospinal fluid for gram stain, bacterial culture, fungal cultures, acid - fast bacilli, _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ antigen, 14 - 3 - 3 protein for creutzfeldt - jakob disease, cytology, and, in addition, ordered eegs, mris, antithyroglobulin antibody, antithyroid peroxidase antibody, tsh, ammonia, methyl malonic acid, and, in addition, considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti - ma, anti - ta, anti - cv2, anti - hu, anti - yo antibodies. in addition, from a renal perspective, the patient was placed on a tuesday, thursday, saturday dialysis schedule. for her hypertension, shewas given lisinopril. for her fen, the patient was able to take po ' s and, per speech and swallow consult, was permitted to take po ' s with one to one supervision. for prophylaxis, the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and nexium. from an infectious disease perspective, the patient remained afebrile and, despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of 08 / 10 through 08 / 12 / 2002, has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12. 0. no obvious source of infection was found, with negative cultures from blood, urine, sputum, the peritoneal fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid. excellent suggestions from dr. pa of the renal service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant, given the patient ' s weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient. however, these antibodies were both within normal limits. the patient ' s mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from 08 / 10 through 08", "4": "/ 12 and was markedly improved on 08 / 13 / 2002, compared with the day of admission. however, the patient remains not oriented to time or to place, although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately. the nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear, with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood, csf, sputum, urine, or peritoneal fluid. on the abdominal ct scan, there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer. ca - 125 levels were within normal limits. we entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion. we will discuss the case further with the neurology service, who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending. pending no further suggestions on their part, we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the termarimed pending no further suggestions from neurology or other consultants. lenni e. hodgkin, m. d., ph. d dictating for : electronically signed lenni e. hodgkin, m. d., ph. d 08 / 20 / 2002 07 : 46 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ avejoh iry such, m. d. tr : yy dd : 08 / 13 / 2002 td : 08 / 14 / 2002 7 : 36 a 909544 cc : avejoh iry such, m. d. stat [ report _ end ]"}, "3022": {"0": "54187451 nvh 30326277 11 / 26 / 2002 12 : 00 : 00 am laparoscopic staging 11 / 26 / 02 dis admission date : 11 / 26 / 2002 report status : discharge date : 11 / 30 / 2002 * * * * * * discharge orders kote, lyfranklapalm 042 -

the patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods. a swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient. several ng tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the ng tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared. the patient was sustained on iv fluids with d10 and multivitamins, thiamine, and folate. he was kept npo given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient ' s mental status cleared he was responsive to having an ng feeding tube placed with jevity feeds started. other options were considered including a peg placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube, however, it was felt that less aggressive measures with an ng tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient ' s poor prognosis for the future. the family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient ' s nutritional status and originally felt that iv fluids alone should be used, however, finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the ng tube was the initial thought. it is felt that if the ng tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube, however, it is felt by", "3": "all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first egd on admission. 4 ) pulmonary - the patient had a clear chest x - ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission. the patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper gi bleed on 9 / 22 / 93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x - ray. the chest x - ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x - ray. however, after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10, 000 to 16, 000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia. the patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve. no organism was ever cultured out of the sputum. 5 ) gu - the patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent. it was thought that a foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well. he had at one point the possibility of uti but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection. the patient continued to be asymptomatic. 6 ) neurological - the patient originally was almost completely non - responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult. the patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate, however, he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth. these issues were explained to him repeatedly, however, he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day. psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs. 7 )", "4": "social issues - the wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient. it was decided the patient ' s code status would not be dnr, dni. 8 ) dental - the patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing xrt in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his xrt. he underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9 / 21 / 93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a gi bleed. laboratory data on discharge revealed sma 7 with sodium 134, potassium 4. 4, chloride 103, co2 24, bun 5, and creatinine 0. 9 which has been stable at 0. 9 to 1. 0 with glucose 96. cbc revealed hct 30. 7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week. the white count was 7. 5, platelets 196. the last pt and ptt on 09 / 26 / 93 were 13. 4 and 27. 3 with inr of 1. 2. the last ua and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on 09 / 27 / 93. the patient had a chest x - ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow - up chest x - ray on 09 / 27 / 93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows. a faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern, however, it was suggested that follow - up chest x - ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve. operative procedures : extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on 9 / 21 / 93. complications : 1 ) aspiration pneumonia. 2 ) gi bleed. 3 ) ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation. disposition : condition on discharge : the patient is stable on discharge. the patient is to be transferred to paw. ryfear medical center for further care including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and further nutritional support. discharge medications : pepcid 20 mg po iv b. i", "5": ". d. for history of gastritis and gi bleed, heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b. i. d.

nutritional status. 7 ) thrombocytopenia status post bone marrow transplant. 8 ) multiple myeloma. history of present illness : this is a 59 - year - old white male. the patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990. he underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10 / 92 at petersly hospital and medical center. at that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cgy. this bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of vad subsequently. in 08 / 94, the patient developed lower back pain. a workup done in de is not available at the time of this dictation. according to her scanty records, an mri of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in t4 and t8 with no cord compression at that time. he was then treated with radiation therapy from t3 to t9 receiving 2500 cgy from 08 / 94 to 09 / 94. he has been on decadron since 08 / 94. about two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain, burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs. he also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities. he stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair. an mri without gadolinium done on 11 / 20 / 94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from t9 to t12. there was evidence of cord compression. the patient ' s decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on ms contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the petersly hospital and medical center. however, one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain. over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital, the

stool, no perirectal lesions or erythema. extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense, purple - red, swollen, and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender. there was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity. neurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice, oriented to person, retelk county medical center, and date, able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination. cranial nerves intact. motor exam normal tone, positive asterixis, no drift. strength was decreased in both lower extremities. coordination was normal with good finger to nose, gait was not tested. deep tendon reflexes were 2 + in the upper extremities, 1 + in the patella reflexes, no reflexes at the

at the right posterior lateral t9 to t12 area invading the neural foramina. there was no csf density. these findings were consistent with the cord compression. hospital course : by problems - 1 ) infectious disease / cellulitis : the patient ' s clinical situation was most consistent with a pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis. blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out pseudomonas that was sensitive to im", "3": "##ipenem and tobramycin. there were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at retelk county medical center and those also grew out pseudomonas aeruginosa. the organism grown at this institution was sensitive to imipenem, ceftazidime, amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin but was resistant to cefotetan, ceftriaxone, mezlocillin, bactrim, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and sulbactam. he was treated initially with ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism ' s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital. he was subsequently switched to imipenem and tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course. the tobramycin and imipenem were started on 11 / 25 / 94. in addition, the patient received a five day course of intravenous igg to improve infection control. vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11 / 28 / 94 and this was primarily to provide improved mrsa coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity. he was evaluated by the surgery department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time. he is being maintained with twice daily xeroform with betadine changes. these dressing changes are applied by applying the xeroform on betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages. of note, the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes. the plan is to complete a full course of imipenem and tobramycin for his pseudomonas cellulitis. as mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh. the cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression. 2 ) cardiovascular : the patient was initially treated with dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved. he was noted to be in rapid af on several episodes receiving 5 mg iv lopressor each time with improvement. he has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sin", "4": "##us rhythm. an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global ef. the patient is being maintained on digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. he has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization. the plan is to continue the digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better. 3 ) oncology : the patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine. he has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay. the plan is to complete a full course of xrt to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma. the patient ' s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied, however, the mri appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy. 4 ) neurologic : as mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids. he was initially treated with iv decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h. his neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema. his decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg iv q6h on 12 / 3 / 94. his decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely. 5 ) blood sugars : the patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus. he has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving nph in the morning and night in addition to a czi sliding scale on a q6h basis. the plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high. 6 ) respiratory : he initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90 %. however, with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his o2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93 %. he can be given intravenous lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema. 7 ) nutrition : the patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia. he has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued. he", "5": "should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained. 8 ) elevated pt and ptt : both of these responded to three day course of vitamin k 10 mg each day. his pt and ptt are now normal, however, he continues to run a low platelet count. this has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant. we have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20, 000 to reduce his bleeding risk. he also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his hct around 30. thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient. disposition : discharge medications : tylenol 650 mg po q4h p. r. n., dulcolax 10 mg per rectum b. i. d. p. r.

g to aspiration pneumonia. he was continued on his parkinson ' s medications. a head ct was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals. head ct results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas, now with slight midline shift. dr. factor agreed he would review the cts and follow the", "1": "patient while in house. he was seen by urology, who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms. he was seen by neuro, who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re - bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes. the patient ' s mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics, doing much better, was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full arnsperni health services. bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration. he did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued. thus, he was considered ready for discharge. he again became much more somnolent, there was a question whether he had re -

unremarkable. pulses were 2 + and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits. hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital on 9 - 8", "1": "- 94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here - transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the exwagh9t protocol. his operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively, he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively. he then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement. during this time, he never developed a fever, leukocytosis, or peritoneal signs. despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs, on the day of the operation, he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain. an x - ray at the time revealed free air. the patient was therefore brought to the operating room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity. he was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon. he therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation. the subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon. the patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated. a renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection. it was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself. with just observation alone, his creatinine returned to a level of 2. 0 by the time of discharge. at the time of this dictation, the patient is doing quite well, eating, ambulating, and taking his medications. the patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic. it is anticipated that in three to four months, we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take - down. postoperatively, the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as", "2": "well as perioperative stress. he ruled out for myocardial infarction. an echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities. a holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions. the patient was seen in consultation and evaluated by cardiology and in the end, he was well controlled on digoxin, propanolol, and verapamil. again, he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came

he had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer. he had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound. he had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately", "1": "when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management. we discussed the risks with his family. it was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath. the family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50 % chance of success. special procedures and operations : esophagoscopy, bronchoscopy, pericardectomy, excision of gastric ulcer, repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on december 4, 1995 by dr. reg cranka and dr. win shufffyfe. in lieu

his upper extremities. the patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease. 2. cardiac : the patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure. he had a cardiac catheterization on december 1, 1995 that showed no complications, elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension. the cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2. 9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal. a full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials. the patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on december 11, 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion, trace mitral regurgitation, normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64 %. there is doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation. there is trace pulmonary insufficiency. the right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on december 6, 1995. a copy", "2": "of this ultrasound is also found in his records. the patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition. 3. respiratory : the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest. these may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed. the patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge. the patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal. his medications for his respiratory system are albuterol nebulizer 0. 5 mg. 2. 5 cc. q4hours. 3. gi : the patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy. the patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on december 25, 1995. this showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract. there is no fistula seen. dr. asha vengloan of general surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient ' s nutrition. the patient takes poorly his po. diet. however he is able to swallow and tolerate po ' s. he just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding. the patient is able to tolerate po. medicines. 4. gu : the patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes. it has been noted to be improving. the patient has a foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his foley catheter may be removed. until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes. 5. skin : the patient has multiple decubiti over his body, in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti. plastic surgery was consulted dr. ca shuff who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point. these wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings. the patient ' s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased. 6. infectious disease : the patient ' s white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits. the patient", "3": "remains on

history of present illness : mr. stone is a 59 - year - old gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and rectal cancer, who was scheduled for a resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the medicine team for improvement of his heart failure. he has a long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy, presumably due to alcohol. he has mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and an aortic valve area of 1. 1 cm. squared with a peak gradient of 36 to 54. he has also had atrial fibrillation since 1990, which has been rate controlled on digoxin. he was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon following an episode of bright red blood per rectum and 3. 5 - cm. sessile lesion at 27 cm., which was biopsied through a colonoscopy, which revealed adenocarcinoma. past medical history : alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 %. adenocarcinoma of the colon. cirrhosis. atrial fibrillation since 1990. recurrent urinary tract infections. mitral valve regurgitation of 4 +. tricuspid regurgitation. aortic stenosis. cellulitis and sepsis in 1992. hyponatremia. peripheral vascular disease. admission medications : lasix 40 mg. b. i. d. tagamet 400 mg. b. i. d. lisinopril 10 mg. q. day. digoxin 0. 25 mg. q. day. cipro 250 mg. b. i. d. allergies : sulfa medications. physical examination : his temperature was 99. blood pressure was 104 / 66. heart rate", "1": "was 110. oxygen saturation was 97 % on room air. he had jugular venous distention to the level of the jaw in the upright position. his heart rate was irregularly with a 2 / 6 holosystolic murmur. his chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one - halfway up the chest. his abdomen was soft and nontender with a positive fluid wave and a liver edge 3 cm. below the costal margin. hospital course : he was admitted to the medicine service and diuresed with lasix and started on captopril with the lisinopril discontinued. after aggressive diuresis on the medical service, he was deemed stable for surgery. after many discussions between dr. leickgrend, the patient, and his family, concerning the severely high risk, given the patient ' s conditions, it was decided to proceed with the operation. on 4 / 27 / 95, he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia. his fluids were very strongly restricted, and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the operating room with 400 cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated. he was taken to the post - surgical intensive care unit, intubated and stable. he continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator. he was finally extubated on 5 / 10 / 95, and despite respiratory rates in the 30s and very coarse, rhonchorous breath sounds, the patient continued to have acceptable oxygen saturation and acceptable blood gases on minimal oxygen. his status, however, remained volatile, and in keeping his volume status somewhat on the dry side to optimize his pulmonary status, he became relatively oliguric and hypernatremic. he required some fluid boluses with d - 5 - w to improve his renal function, intravascular volume, and electrolyte balance. on 5 / 14 / 95, he returned to the surgical intensive care unit for very aggressive pulmonary toilet. on 5 / 15 / 95, he was taken to the angio suite for an attempted transhepatic internal jugular porta caval shunt. his portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm., going from 26 to 23, so no shunt was placed. on 5 / 17, he spiked a", "2": "temperature to 103 with rigors and shaking chills. his respiratory status decompensated acutely, and he required reintubation emergently. at that time, multiple discussions were held with the family, and they decided to enact a do not resuscitate order. mr. stone ' s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine. his urine output remained very low. his white blood cell count rose to 22, 000 with a 50 % bandemia. a swan - ganz catheter revealed an svr of 350, and he was started on neo - synephrine and epinephrine prior to the do not resuscitate order. throughout the day on 5 / 18 / 95, his blood pressure continued to fall in the 80s, then 70s, then 60s, and at 3 : 15 a. m. on 5 / 19 / 95, despite multiple pressors, his blood pressure dropped down to 50 ; he then went into ventricular fibrillation, followed by flat line. at that time, he had no spontaneous respirations and no audible heart tones. he had no carotid pulses, no gag reflex, and no pupillary reflex, and his pupils were fixed and dilated. he was pronounced dead at 3 : 15 a. m. the family was contacted and were present at his bedside. a postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family. dictated by : nila s. kayschird, m. d. ew96

and treated with surgery, radiation, and hormonal treatment. she had actually completed her five years of tomaxifin, but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks, she began an estrogen patch. not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull, ribs, arms, etc... but no visceral involvement. she ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain. she had no fevers, chills, headaches, or neck stiffness. there had been no focal neurologic changes. up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease. on admission to the hospital her temperature was 99, heart rate 99, blood pressure 151 / 87, o2 saturation on room air was 92 %. she did look mildly dyspneic. her lungs were clear. she had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement. she was oriented to place and name and", "1": "this waxed and waned over the next couple of days. the rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact. laboratory data : sodium of 137, bun of 25, creatinine of 0. 9, glucose of 77, calcium slightly high at 10. 9 with an albumin of 3. 7. bilirubin normal. her alt 11, her ast slightly up at 59. her alk phos slightly up at 174. wbc 10. 8 with normal differential. hemoglobin 12. 2, hematocrit 36. 6, mcv 89, platelets 345, 0000. a urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10 - 20 red cells and 20 - 50 white cells. a ca 153 was significantly elevated at 66. 5 ( normal 0 - 30 ). the patient was brought to the floor, hydrated gently, given another dose of zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates. she gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle. this was assessed promptly by an x - ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site. she also went on to have cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral mris to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression. she had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of physical therapy. a single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain. her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open. the sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks. plan : escalate the doses of the dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8", "2": "o ' clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule, adding on remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional ssri overlap until it seems to show more affect. she lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single - handedly, hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab. the patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest. she was begun on letrazole as an _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to dr. first ' s office to have further discussions of this later approach. discharge medications : zofran

basal ganglia degeneration process, but this was not clarified during this admission. it was not felt likely to be due to parkinson ' s disease, as he had no significant response to eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor, although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic. he had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on october 18, 1996. this showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct, but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy. in addition, he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage, so tumor was felt to be unlikely. however, this issue will need to be re - evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage. the etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension, but these other causes could also not be ruled out. 2 ) cardiovascular : his electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia. he was on intravenous tng and was supratherapeutic on his anti - coagulation. he did have a slight elevation of his tpk with an additional value of 198 with a mb fraction of 5. 7, which makes for a percentage of 2. 9. that was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1. 6, 1. 0 on subsequent ckmbs and was felt", "4": "that he had a very small \" leaflet \". he remained chest pain free throughout his admission. 3 ) pulmonary : after his initial intubation he remained quite stable. he was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex. however, he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission. 4 ) hematology : he had his prothrombin time reversed with vitamin k 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room. his anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation, but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed. it was decided that his goal inr was to be 2. 0. he did drop below 1. 5 at one time, at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period, but his discharge inr was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time. it was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems. 5 ) gastrointestinal : he was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the ph university of medical center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision. thus, his nasogastric tube was discontinued on october 19, 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well. in discussions with the family, given his age and number of medical problems, it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions. however, he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure. the family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good, but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary, short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest. disposition / plan on discharge : stable. doctor ' s discharge orders : the patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital, the location of", "5": "which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary. the patient is to follow up with dr. ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim. medications on discharge : dilantin 100 mgs po tid, carafate 1 gram po qid, digoxin 0. 25 mgs po qd, isordil 20 mgs po tid, captopril 25 mgs po tid, lopressor 50 mgs po bid, colace 100 mgs po tid, and coumadin 2 mgs po qhs. ti call, m. d. tr : fcz dd : 10 / 21 / 96 td : 10 / 21 / 96 2 : 07 a cc : ti shemau call, m. d. asha e vengloan, m. d. lydell r worce, m. d. / stat [ report _ end ]"}, "3122": {"0": "12738719 ctmc 69103594 994465 7 / 18 / 1990 12 : 00 : 00 am discharge summary unsigned dis admission date : 07 / 18 / 1990 report status : unsigned discharge date : 07 / 20 / 1990 discharge diagnosis : left hand ring and little finger proximal interphalangeal joint dislocation, open. operations and procedures : none. complications none. hospital course : the patient was admitted and had the above diagnosis. the patient refused irrigation of the wound in the operating room. the patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and handwashing. there were no signs of infection or septic arthritis at the time of discharge. phyical examination of the left hand shows that the ring and little finger proximal interphalangeal joint are reduced. there is approximately 40 degrees of active motion secondary to swelling. no evidence of septic arthritis. disposition : patient to return to home. discharge medications : keflex 500 mg p. o. q. i. d. times four days. dressing changes b. i. d. with dry kerlix wrap around little finger and ring finger. wash with soap and water b. i. d. physical therapy and occupational therapy arranged as an out -

tube feedings were not ideal. he underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the interventional radiologist on feb 04, 1997. prior to admission mr. marker had been taking one can of jevity every two hours as a bolus. after conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings, however mr. marker did not want to use continuous feedings, he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube. it was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings. his visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained. his lumbar drain was removed after five days. he was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak. he is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen. medications on discharge : 1 ) ofloxacin 400 mg p. o. b. i. d. for one week. 2 ) jevity plus one can q. 2h. he will have visiting nurse and home physical therapy services. follow -

50 % proximal stenosis and a co - dominant left circumflex with mild disease. he subsequently had an echocardiogram in december 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function. he subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in february 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction. in december 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations. he was diagnosed with wolfe parkinson white syndrome. he underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by dr. slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful. he was treated with sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia. on 9 / 2 / 98 he was admitted to cay memorial hospital of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway. he had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of lasix.", "1": "an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50 % and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. he was discharged home but returned on 9 / 13 / 98 with worsening palpitations on and off. he was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium. he denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction. he continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to ph university of medical center for further evaluation and management. prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes. past medical history : hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, depression, prostate cancer status post surgery. medications on admission : sotalol 160 mg bid. atenolol 25 mg bid. prilosec 20 mg qd. propulsid 10 mg qd. nph and czi insulin. resulin 400 mg qd. lisinopril 10 mg bid. aspirin. lasix 60 mg qd. allergies : he reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine. there was also a question of an allergy to prednisone which he said causes eye swelling. however, the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy. physical exam : he was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156 / 78, pulse 56 and respirations of 16. his lungs were clear throughout. his apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm, normal s1 and s2 but not s3 or s4. there was a grade 1 / 6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex. carotid pulses were 2 + bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention. his abdomen was benign. femoral pulses were 2 + bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally. laboratory data : bun 18, creatinine 1. 8, magnesium 1. 5, cholesterol 154 with an hdl 41, ldl 100. his creatinine phosphokinase was 42. his hematocrit was 49. 3. his electrocardio", "2": "##gram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with wolf parkinson white syndrome. there were also nonspecific st - t wave abnormalities. hospital course and treatment : the patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations. given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study. his initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to prednisone. he was seen by nnoatal hospital center who felt that he could be safely treated with solumedrol rather than prednisone together with benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium. accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9 / 17 / 98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20. his right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals. he had a 50 % proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex. his left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation. the patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9 / 20 / 98. there was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract. mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract. radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively - excitation. there were no complications. following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia. he still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations. in following up his ablation he underwent a holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80. there were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100. he also underwent a post - procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61 % with mild mitral regurgitation and left", "3": "atrial enlargement at 45mm. following the procedure his qt interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately. 55 seconds. his sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his qt and qtc intervals decreased to. 45 -. 48 seconds. after the procedure he was started on heparin and loaded on coumadin for a period of the next 3 - 4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation. his inr was 2. 3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow - up with the anticoagulation clinic to follow his coumadin dose. finally, his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his ep study. accordingly he was seen by neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process. he did have a head ct which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke. finally, his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of sotalol. given his occasional sinus bradycardia his atenolol was not advanced but instead his zestril dose was increased from 10 -

upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination. she had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position. her ear examination was normal. nasal examination was normal. oral cavity was normal. neck : revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass. neck : otherwise normal and the trachea was midline. hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous, yellowish - white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema. the left pyriform was obliterated by edema. the right pyriform was narrowed by edema. the epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx. the patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis. there was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area. lungs : clear. heart : regular rate and rhythm. s1 and s2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops. abdomen : soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds,

platelet count of 268, differential 94 polys, 0 bands, 5 lymphs, one mono. as noted above, lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis. the chest x - ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative. hospital course : the patient", "2": "was felt to have epiglottitis, possibly secondary to a malignancy, especially in her age group. she was started on iv ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification. due to the marked amount of edema, it was felt that she should go the operating room emergently for elective intubation. she was taken to the operating room at approximately 2 : 00 a. m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ent and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a # 6 endotracheal tube. the patient was sedated. direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted. she was transferred to the sicu where she was kept sedated and was given ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as iv steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. x 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the emergency room on the way down to the operating room. her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the operating room. at the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the sicu house office. her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the operating room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed. she had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150. she was given a dose of digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the digoxin was given. ekg and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree av block that she had had on her preoperative ekg but no other findings at all. she continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the icu where she was monitored. her blood gases and o2 saturations correlated well and we used o2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good o2 saturation. she was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated. she went into an s", "3": "##vt the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to digitalize her, keeping her level between approximately. 6 and 1. she continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of svt and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that. her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4 / 3 and 4 / 4 revealed decreasing edema. on 4 / 5 / 91 in the icu under controlled conditions, she was electively extubated and had no problems. she was kept on ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given. examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold. otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis. of note, during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin. once the steroids were stopped, the insulin was able to be stopped. tube feedings were started on 4 / 3 / 91 and the ng tube was discontinued on 4 / 5 / 91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her. after extubation she was watched in the icu for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning. again, mi was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits. o2 saturations looked good. it was felt that this was a mild episode of icu psychosis. she was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway. she was maintained on ceftriaxone and then switched to augmentin and remained afebrile. her white counts came down. blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative. she had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications. cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all digoxin and just watched and that her svts may have been just secondary to stress of intubation. unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and svt were apparently not documented well enough in terms of ekg strips to aid cardiology and", "4": "therefore, they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart. nonetheless, their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of digoxin and had no further problems with her heart. her mental status began to clear under the family ' s request. disposition : on 4 / 9 / 91 she was sent home on a week of augmentin and will followup in the ent clinic. our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion. she, of note, had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area. if she does have a lesion, then we may entertain, given her age, the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy. discharge medications are augmentin 500 mg t. i. d. x 7 days. the patient is to followup in the ent clinic in approximately one week. discharge diagnosis : epiglottitis, question secondary to epiglottic malignancy. rg556 /

50 ' s. because of angina following that catheterization, he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery. he did well until he developed recurrent angina in march of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second ptca with good results. he again did well until approximately late l992. since that time, he has had multiple admissions to george ' sdgot medical center with recurrent chest pain. he has ruled in for small r q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions. he has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non - invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40 ' s and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in august of l994 at 31 %. he was admitted to george ' sdgot medical center with a typical episode of this discomfort in october of l994. he was transferred at that time to the ph university of medical center. that was his first ph university of medical center admission. because of mr. leach ' s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary", "1": "disease, it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve. his angiograms from morehegron valley hospital from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications. he was taken to the catheter laboratory on october 13, 1994. there he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures. repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system. he then underwent a doppler coronary flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve. specifically, his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2 - 2. 5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3 - 4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus. following the coronary flow studies, he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm. he had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm. however, he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin. it was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina. he was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home. following that admission in october he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months. starting in the october of l994, he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort. this occurred at rest and with exercise. he had multiple admissions to the morehegron valley hospital once again ruling in for a small r q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions. his medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain. his most recent admission to the morehegron valley hospital is on april 5, of 1994. he had", "2": "a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small q wave myocardial infarction. because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms, he was transferred to ph university of medical center on 4 - 9 - 94. his medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and lodapine cardiazem, nifidepine and coumadin, aspirin, cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists. there is no history of drug abuse or smoking. of note, his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20 ' s. there is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state. of note, his prior work - up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein s and c and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy. his medications on admission included isordil, lovastatin, aspirin, heparin and lodapine, cardizem and lasix. physical examination : he looked generally well. his blood pressure l60 / 90. his heart rate was 88. his jugular venous pressure was normal. his chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur. his abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly. his femoral pulses were l + and equal without bruits. he had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses. his initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38. potassium of 3. 2. normal chloride and co2. his bun was 12 and his creatinine was 1. 1. glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal. his fasting cholesterol was 174 with an hdl of 35 and an ldh of 97. his liver function tests were normal with the exception of his ldh which was mildly elevated to 222. his hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count. his sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing. hospital course : the primary concern upon mr. leach ' s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheter", "3": "##izations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease. it was ; therefore, felt appropriate to start his repeat work - up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. to that end, he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 4 - 10 - 94, there he underwent right and left heart catheterization, coronary angiography and left ventriculography. the right heart catheter which was done using a swanz ganz catheter advanced to 8 french sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury. the left ventricular pressure was l05 / 12. coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from october of l994. that is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities. left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35 %. impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic. he was ; therefore, seen in consultation by dr. lato tikfreierm of the hematology service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events. after an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of mr. leach ' s platelets, it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect. specifically, his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability. this was utilized in making some changes in mr. leach ' s regiment. specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b. i. d. repeat in vitro testing of mr. leach ' s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin, they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the tic", "4": "##lopidine effect. while in the hospital, mr. leach continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain. these were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration. there were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i. v. narcotics for complete pain relief. because of the ongoing nature of his pain. multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen. he was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome. he was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil. amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome. the rest of his hypercoagulable work - up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors, specifically, his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80 - 120. protein c was 85 with a reference range of 70 -

up was undertaken. he had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma, these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines, but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves. it was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma.", "5": "his compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis, b serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process. because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen, it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome. to evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure, a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection. prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on may 13. that study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant st changes with exercise, he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i. v. morphine sulfate. on the basis of that test, he underwent stellate block the following day. that was performed in the pain clinic using l % lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of t1. this produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye. he was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done. he once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort. this encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade. after extended discussions with pain service, mr. leach was brought back down to the pain clinic on october 27. there a catheter was placed at the level of t1 under fluroscopic guidance. once again narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block. the catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina. after extensive discussions with the patient, the pain service and thoracic surgery, it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome. therefore, on october 27, the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by dr. aalv sctroi. he tolerated", "6": "that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization. he had incisional pain which was well -

seizure medicine, she calmed down very nicely in terms of not having any additional seizures. for the last several days of her hospitalization, we switched her over to a duragesic patch and she actually took 300 micrograms per hour of duragesic and that seemed to make a big difference in terms of her pain control. her headache came under very nice control with aggressive duragesic patch. access became a major problem and we had dr. anruchelle chaffchird from surgical oncology place a double port - a - cath without difficulty. the plan with knutzxelljesc will be to follow her very carefully. she will be coming back to see us next tuesday for infusion of her methotrexate. ca nermoone, m. d. tr : fe / bmot dd : 11 -

a adenocarcinoma of the breast", "1": ". since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor, she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. the patient was treated with cmsap, which is cytoxan, methotrexate, leukovoranrescue, 5 -

staging done in april 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis. in may 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and velban and methotrexate, which required some red cell transfusions. in mid may she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a uti with blood clots in the urine. the patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100. she has also been having diarrhea since november and her other complaints of admission include confusion, nausea and vomiting. we will include a very thorough hpi with this dictation that was done by dr. wedleung. past medical history : significant for metastatic breast cancer, complicated by fever and neutropenia. utis, obstruction of", "2": "the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein, herpes zoster. status post ovarian cyst resection in 1975. she had menarche at age 15. she used the pill for five years in the past. she is g 2, p 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries. she has a history of easy bruis ability. she is allergic to augmentin which gives her a rash. medications : ms contin, msir, and percocet. family history : noncontributory. social history : married with two children. she worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children. she denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially. physical examination : a cachectic white female. t 100. 1, p 104, blood pressure 130 / 90, heart rate of 16, she was sating 95 % on room air. heent -

trace protein, trace ketones, positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1 + bacteria. chest x - ray - showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia. in summary, the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell ca, status post chemotherapy with cmsap and pvsc and xrt who presented with fever, four days of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting and had been on keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall. the keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea. when she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with iv antibiotics. so she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called santyl, which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her. also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative taxol chemotherapy, which the patient declined. she refused the taxol therapy so that was not done. another major issue with this patient was pain control. she had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion. so pain control was a big issue so she was on ms contin and msir at home she thought that clouded her thinking, so we tried different things for pain management. one of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at c6 - c7 interface on 1 - 6 - 94. after that the patient had minimal relief of pain. however, she declined further blocks, which were offered to her. so accepted to be on dilaudid p. o. which was started at a dosage of 2 - 4 meg but since then we have tapered it up. she is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch. she is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours. we can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of", "4": "pain. other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead ct for her on the 8th of january because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status, which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking. we went ahead and got a head ct scanand it showed no enhancing lesions. in addition her liver transaminases were elevated, we thought about doing further work - up, but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that. that has been stable. the patient on january 13 became hyponatremic. her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133. a renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as siadh. we proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it. we had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction. in addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped, so that now at the time of discharge, the patient ' s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. so that has really improved. we suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day. on the 14th of january, the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x - ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with hampton ' s hump. also a vq scan obtained the next day showed high probability for pe. so we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin, we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2. 5 mg q. h. s. her inr is 2. 3. we want her inr to remain between 2 and 3. so if it goes much lower than 2, then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2. 5 and 5 alternating every other night. however, we would leave it at 2. 5 for now. other major issues - as a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems, her blood pressure was elevated", "5": "also. we put her on nifedipine ir, sl and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic, so we had started her on atenolol. so on discharge she is on atenolol 100. if needed to you can give her some nifedipine sl to decrease her blood pressure. the patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities, so i think that fluid restriction should help with that. she is also a little dry. the patient is on oxygen. ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen. she was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters, sating 94 to 96 % on 5 liters. we would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well. the complications that i have listed include the hyponatremia, pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure. disposition : discharge medications -

has a history of failing memory and difficulty with gait, dating back to 1993 when he had a cat scan which was said to be unremarkable, however, over the past year he has progressively deteriorated in terms of his memory and mental function and over the past six months has rapidly deterioratedwith his gait so that it has recently been very difficult for him to maintain his balance and walk unassisted. finally, he fell in his bath tub and was unable to get up. a nursing assessment thought that it was unsafe for the patient to be at home so he was admitted to the hospital for evaluation. physical examination : there was no evidence of serious trauma. his general examination revealed a blood pressure of 145 / 80 ; pulse of 72 and regular. he was in no acute distress. his neck was supple. the chest was normal. the cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs noted. the carotids were normal. there were no bruits. there was some paravertebral

showed an old l - 9 compression fracture which was confirmed on cat scanning. hospital course and treatment : the patient was evaluated by dr. doll grendbly from the neurology service who thought that there was a good possibility that he had parkinson ' s disease with certainly some parkinsonian features to his picture. however, some of his features could be explained by normal pressure hydrocephalus although the normal head scan seemed to exclude that. there was also a question of alzheimer ' s disease to explain his dementia. dr. block recommended a trial of sinemet therapy which

received nebulizer treatments with albuterol. he was also started on intravenous ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia. he was diuresed with intravenous lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2l urine output on the first day and 1. 5l the second day. after one day in the medical intensive care unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment. this consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous solu - medrol. as the patient ' s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved. a chest x - ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x - ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe. the patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia. the antibiotic chosen was levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day. this was started on 4 / 2 / 99 and should be continued for ten days. the ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia. the patient ' s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2 - 3 days of his hospitalization the

nausea, vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. the patient ' s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to prilosec. while in oaksgekesser / memorial hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently. it is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living. discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home. they wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility. condition on discharge : the patient ' s respiratory status was stable. i think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had. he needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for physical therapy to increase his muscle strength. medications on discharge : 1. albuterol 2. 5 mg in 2. 5 normal saline q4h. 2. heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day. 3. ativan. 5 mg twice a

discharge summary signed dis report status : signed discharge summary name : kote, lyfranklapalm unit number : 512 - 13 - 39 admission date : 01 / 18 / 2001 discharge date : history of present illness : this is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to dr. riode area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01 / 98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally. the patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia. he had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft. he also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally. he was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass. the patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of dr. area ' s office, this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking. he has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state. he had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time, most of which was done at the alconspore woocawo medical center. allergies : the patient has no known drug allergies. medications on admission : his medications on admission include coumadin and levofloxacin. his coumadin has been held for two days. his claudication is equal bilaterally. physical examination : on physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits, a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible. his rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the tocon hospital the previous week. he has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet. his pulse", "1": "exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally, but none distally. laboratory data : his bun and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1. 3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10, 000 and 139, 000 platelet count. he has ankle brachial indices of. 36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions. hospital course : dr. area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that i would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis. after discussing with the patient, getting his prothrombin time closer to range, he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm. ep to fe under general endotracheal anesthesia. there was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved. superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded. there was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation, although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis. the profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes. it was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked. the patient postoperatively did quite well. he had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill. his groin incision was healing nicely and he was on heparin, being converted to coumadin.

( 1 ) pneumonia. he was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days. the pneumonia was found to be multilobar, and accompanied by significant hypoxia. he was started on broad spectrum coverage, including ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin. the ration off for the utilization of the ciprofloxacin, was that because of his allergy to erythromycin, an alternative regimen was needed to cover for legionella, which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission, because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities. however, he was isolated, and three afb smears were obtained, in order to rule out tuberculosis. in addition, sputum induction was performed for pneumocystis, which was negative. his urinary legionella antigen subsequently came back negative. however, this test is only 85 - 95 % sensitive for legionella pneumophila, type", "3": "i, which is the subtype that causes some 80 % of legionnaires disease. however, the legionella antigen is neither sensitive, nor specific, for other legionella species that may be involved in legionella pneumonia. therefore, the ciprofloxacin was continued. in addition, his sputum cultures were all negative, as of the day of admission. after admission, with the initiation of antibiotic therapy, mr. cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic. however, within one to two days after admission, he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week, post admission. because of persistent hypoxemia on room air, as well as nasal cannula, some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia, ( i. e. malignancy ). therefore, an evaluation by the pulmonary team of the tonwe hospital, as well as a sputum cytology and chest ct scan, were all obtained. the chest ct scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs, as well as the previously noted right pneumonia, with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae. his sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge. the pulmonary team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings, laboratory values, and radiologic features, all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. therefore, his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease. despite being afebrile, with significant decrease in his cough, mr. cliffestreukote will be maintained, after discharge, on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy, to complete a full course. it should be noted, that clindamycin was discontinued, approximately three days after admission, because of the development of diarrhea. additionally, when switched to oral medication, mr. cliffestreukote was switched to augmentin 500 mg. p. o. t. i. d., as well as continuing on his ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p. o. b. i. d.
