        "HOSPITAL COURSE -12": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\nThey agreed with our plan .\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .",
        "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE -13": "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE  \nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .",

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS -8": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  \nThis is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .\nMr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .\nHe had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .\nHis course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .\nIn August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .\nHe rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .\nHe was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .\nAn automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .\nHe was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .\nBecause of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .\nMr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .\nHe was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .\nColonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum .\nA perirectal fistula was seen .\nTreatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .\nOn the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .\nHe presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .\nHe was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .\nHypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\nHe is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION -9": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  \nPhysical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .\nHis CVP was 16 .\nHe was on the balloon pump at the time .\nHis chest was clear anteriorly .\nHis cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .\nNo murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .\nHis abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .\nHis feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .",
        "LABORATORY DATA -10": "LABORATORY DATA  \nAdmission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .\nThe sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .\nElectrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .\nThere were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .\nThe chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE -11": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nMr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .\nHe was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .\nIt was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .\nAfter replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .\nHe did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .\nIt was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .\nHe also remained intubated .\nMr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn 's disease .\nAll of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .\nAs Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .\nHe was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .\nDr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .\nProcainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .\nInitially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .\nAs Mr. Given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .\nThis resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .\nHe was able to get some fluid off as well .\nWith getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .\nHis cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .\nOn 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .\nWith a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .\nThe balloon pump was restored .\nHe was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .\nHe continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .\nSupportive care continued .\nUnfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .\nBroad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .\nMr. Given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize .\nAnother effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .\nHe had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .\nHemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .\nHe did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .\nHis hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .\nHe continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .\nAnother effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .\nThis resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .\nHe did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\nOn 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .\nThe patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .\nHe began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\nThe patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .\nIndicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .\nHe developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .\nCAGHALA R.

        "HOSPITAL COURSE -8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nBy systems -\n1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .\nExtraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .\nEGD was performed .\nSubsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .\nThere was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .\nThe patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately 9/22/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .\nThe patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .\nThe patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .\nOther GI issues include the patient 's hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .\n2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .\nBecause of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .\n3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .\nA swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .\nSeveral NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .\nThe patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .\nHe was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient 's mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .\nOther options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient 's poor prognosis for the future .\nThe family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient 's nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .\nIt is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .\n4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .\nThe patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .\nThe chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .\nHowever , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .\nThe patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .\nNo organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .\n5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .\nIt was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .\nHe had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .\nThe patient continued to be asymptomatic .\n6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .\nThe patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .\nThese issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .\nPsychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .\n7) Social issues -

        "ALLERGIES -10": "ALLERGIES  \nHe reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .\nThere was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .\nHowever , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .",
        "PHYSICAL EXAM -11": "PHYSICAL EXAM  \nHe was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .\nHis lungs were clear throughout .\nHis apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .\nThere was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .\nCarotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .\nHis abdomen was benign .\nFemoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .",
        "LABORATORY DATA -12": "LABORATORY DATA  \nBUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .\nHis creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .\nHis hematocrit was 49.3 .\nHis electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .\nThere were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT -13": "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  \nThe patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .\nGiven his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .\nHis initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .\nHe was seen by Nnoatal Hospital Center who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .\nAccordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .\nHis right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .\nHe had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .\nHis left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .\nThe patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 .\nThere was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .\nMapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .\nRadiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .\nThere were no complications .\nFollowing the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .\nHe still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .\nIn following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .\nThere were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .\nHe also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .\nFollowing the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .\nHis Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .\nAfter the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .\nHis INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .\nFinally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .\nAccordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .\nHe did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .\nFinally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .\nGiven his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .",
        "CONDITION ON DISCHARGE -14": "CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  \nHe was discharged in stable condition on 9/23/98 .\nHe will have a visiting nurse to see him on Iat .\nFOLLOW-UP :\nHe will follow-up with Dr. Taarnna Service at Ph University Of Medical Center as well as Dr. Lupevickette Folk and Dr. Dwainco Rallsversgach on Villean Garl .",

X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .\nHer initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .\nAt the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .\nHer episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .\nShe had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .\nShe was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .\nEKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .\nShe continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .\nHer blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .\nShe was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .\nShe went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .\nShe continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .\nHer edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema .\nOn 4/5/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .\nShe was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .\nExamination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .\nOtherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .\nOf note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .\nOnce the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .\nTube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .\nAfter extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .\nAgain , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .\nO2 saturations looked good .\nIt was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .\nShe was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .\nShe was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .\nHer white counts came down .\nBlood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .\nShe had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .\nCardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .\nUnfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .\nNonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .\nHer mental status began to clear under the family 's request .",
        "DISPOSITION -12": "DISPOSITION  \nOn 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .\nOur plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .\nShe , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .\nIf she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .\nDischarge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .\nThe patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE -9": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \n# 1. cerebrovascular accident .\nThe patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .\nThis was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .\nThe possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .\nHer echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .\nPrevious echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital .\nHer Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .\nThe patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .\nShe was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .\nHer exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .\nHer pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .\nShe needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .\nIn addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .\nIt is discontinued at the time of transport .\nThe patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .\nDuring evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .\nOn our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .\nThere are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .\nAt the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .\nWhat follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .\nHer ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .\nMoreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .\nOur leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .\nAs I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .\nWhile mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .\nTwo possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .\nThese tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .\nThe results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .\nI will be happy to furnish the results .\nThe patient has a history of MI in 1989 .\nEchocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .\nEKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .\nWe would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .\nPersantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .\nThe patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .\nIt has been evaluated in the past without success .\nDuring her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .\nStudies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .\nStudies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .\nThis is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .\nFlorinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .\nThe patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .\nIn addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .\nThis has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .\nCT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .\nA chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .\nA PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .\nThe left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .\nThe patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .\nDopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .\nIt is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .\nIt is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .\nThe patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .\nWe think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .\nThis can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .\nThe patient has glaucoma .\nHer medications are as listed below .\nHer ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .\nHis name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .",
