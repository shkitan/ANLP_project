venous engorgement .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -9": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nI indicated to Dr. Brown that I had never seen a situation in which an adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical signs suggested aortic stenosis .\nAccordingly , on April 2 , 1993 , he underwent a cardiac catheterization .\nThe study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels .\nThe right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it .\nUsing transeptal catheterization , he proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was no doubt about his aortic stenosis .\nThe left ventricular contraction showed an ejection fraction of around 25% .\nAn attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative .\nOn April 8 , 1993 , Dr. G Hemp performed open heart surgery .\nAt the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement .\nThere was no calcification of the valve , and no clear evidence of infection .\nI have in fact never seen anything quite like this on an aortic porcine valve .\nThe valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction .\nThe surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly .\nMr. No was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with an aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes .\nPostoperatively , the

right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .\nAlso of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .\nPost-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .\nHe remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .\nTransthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .\nThe next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .\nThe patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .\nIn the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .\nOn

with high oxygen requirement .\nChest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .\nAggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .\nIn addition , he remained agitated .\nThis was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .\nOn day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .\nHis urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .\nDespite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .\nHe required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .\nHe received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .\nVery early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .\nWith positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .\nThroughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .\nException was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .\nHis chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .\nInfectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\nCardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .\nConsequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .\nIn addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .\nOn the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .\nOn 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .\nIt was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .\nAt approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .\nThe patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .\nWithin one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .\nThe patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .\nThe patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .\nThe chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .\nCompressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .\nThe patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly

remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .\nHe was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .\nHemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .\nHe had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .\nThis will be discussed below .\nFurther he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .\nAn echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .\nHis ejection fraction was 55% .\nOn 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .\n5-Hepatic failure .\nHis SGPT on admission was

Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .\n8-Pancreatitis .\nThe amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .\nAlthough not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .\n9-Catheter tip infections .\nThe patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .\nThese were treated with Vancomycin .\n10-Anemia .\nThe patient 's hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .\n11-Coma .\nThe patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .\nA CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .\nThe lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient 's persistent coagulopathy .\nThe patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .\nFurther complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .\nDespite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .\nMid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .\nThe patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .\nNevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite

patient was taken to the operating room .\nThe preoperative diagnosis as above was a left brachial embolus .\nThe postoperative diagnosis , the same .\nThe procedure was a left brachial embolectomy .\nThe surgeon was Dr. Home and first assistant Dr. Home .\nThe findings were a thromboembolism with propagated clot in the left brachial artery .\nThere were no complications .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the floor soon after the procedure .\nOn postoperative day # 1 the patient was afebrile with stable vitals and he had a very strong left radial pulse and a warm hand .\nHe was heparinized postoperatively and a cardiology consult was obtained .\nIn addition echocardiography for the next day was arranged .\nThe patient was seen on 5-29-92 by the ward cardiology consult .\nHis assessment was that this was a 76 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation and a dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post two embolic / thrombotic phenomena with a recent history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed .\nHe recommended that the patient be heparinized as the Scabeth T Hospital Surgery Team had already done and that Coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization .\nThese recommendations were already underway .\nConsequently we simply continued our management .\nThe cardiology consult also spoke to the patient 's primary medical doctor , Dr. Blood in Clear La who related that the patient had had two large esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia vera in the past .\nOn 5-30-92 the patient 's gastroenterologist Dr. Ri Blood was contacted .\nDr. Blood was on vacation , however Dr. Kotethorereke , his partner was in the office and went through Mr. Flytheleungfyfe 's old chart and noted that Dr. Blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his North Carolina admission for an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed .\nDuring this time in January of 1992 Dr. Blood had noted two distal esophageal ulcers .\nHe had treated both of these with epinephrine injection .\nFollow up endoscopy on Mar 15 , 1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in January .\nThere was also a 4 cm. hiatus hernia from 36 cm. to 40 cm .\nThe stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal .\nFrom Dr. Blood 's standpoint on Mar 15 , 1992 there was no contraindication to Coumadinization .\nWe discussed Coumadinization with Dr. Blood and noting Dr. Blood 's earlier findings we , in conjunction with Dr. Blood decided to Coumadinize the patient and Coumadinization was begun on 5-30-92 .\nIt was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been Coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day .\nThat was concurrent with Albuterol 150 mg. po q.day .\nGiven the patient 's history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5-31-92 .\nThe findings were as follows .\nThe principal operating surgeon was Dr. Ca Scgach with the assistance of Dr. Jesclinke .\nThe principal findings were a 5.0 cm. hiatal hernia and apparent Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center 's esophagus distally .\nIn the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities .\nThere were no abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum .\nThe overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a Barrett 's esophagus .\nNo biopsy was taken .\nThe biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of Coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure .\nOn 6-1-92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite .\nFindings were :\nthere was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus .\nThere was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation .\nThere was focal calcification in the mitral annulus .\nThe aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis .\nThere was trace aortic insufficiency .\nThe aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters .\nThe left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection fractio n of 57 percent .\nThere was trace tricuspid insufficiency .\nThere was evidence of an old pacer wire in the right atrium .\nThere was trace pulmonary insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters .\nThere was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block .\nThe patient , it should be noted at this time , was doing very well and he was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously .\nHe had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6-2-92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate .\nOn 6-2-92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain .\nHe confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently Rheumatology consult was obtained .\nThe Rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint .\nJoint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo-gout .\nJoint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6-4-92 .\nThe rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification .\nA wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo-gout .\nThe patient 's pseudogout was treated with Colchicine 0.6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms .\nHe is being discharged on Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d. as an acute measure for his pseudo-gout and that prescription will last until he sees Dr. Blood in follow up this coming Tuesday .\nToday , on 6-4-92 , the patient has no new complaint .\nYesterday , on 6-3-92 , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued .\nToday his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of Coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him .\nConsequently , he is ready for discharge today .\nThe only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with Coumadin his Ecotrin has been discontinued .", "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE -13": "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE  \nIsordil 10 mg.

Jescdrig from the Urology Service was consulted in view of the above findings .\nHe requested a Lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with Lasix .\nNeither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed .\nIn view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , Dr. Jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented .\nAs a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed .\nThe patient was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out Escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray .\nShe was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy .\nSputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism .\nOn the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement .\nHer urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour .\nHowever , her BUN and creatinine remained elevated .\nOn 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively .\nHer Coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an I and R of 2.5-3 .\nOn June 5 , 1994 it was decided that Mrs. Neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle I chemotherapy with Ifex , Adriamycin and MESNA .\nShe was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy .\nIn view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from Ancef and Gentamicin to Ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well .\nOn 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise .\nUrinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted .\nA Neuro-Oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to Ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped .\nAn electroencephalogram was requested and was negative .\nNo computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed .\nShe continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours .\nOff her Ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted .\nFor this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum .\nThe mucosa appeared to be preserved .\nIn addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon .\nThe patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 .\nThe patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued .\nHer sensorium had cleared .\nBecause of persistent nausea and vomiting on June 13 , 1994 a KUB and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter .\nThe patient 's white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an ANC of 60 for the next two to three days .\nIn addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 .\nShe was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and GCSF therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia .\nDespite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused .\nA Gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting .\nOn conservative therapy the patient 's nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided .\nA percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube was placed on June 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting .\nOn 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 .\nAnd she was not given platelets in addition .\nThroughout this period the patient 's pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia .\nAfter much discussion with the family and Social Services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable .\nOn August 21 , 1994 a PICC line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) and on 6/23/94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x-ray .\nOn June 23 , 1994 the patient was found to be mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting .\nThe PEG tube was found to be draining well .\nShe was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family .\nIn addition she will be followed by Sephsandpot Center and Dwardsc Center who will arrange for home PCA ( patient

nausea and vomiting , constipation or diarrhea .\nHe had run out of his narcotics for approximately three days .\nAbdominal computerized tomography scan demonstrated extensive hepatic metastases consistent with relapse of his small cell lung carcinoma .\nHis mental status quickly deteriorated after beginning on his standard doses of Fentanyl patch and a head computerized tomography scan was obtained .\nThis demonstrated multiple enhancing masses in all lobes of the brain .\nThere was no hemorrhage seen .\nHe was started on steroids and began radiation therapy .\nHis abdominal pain was easily controlled with narcotics and his neurological deficits persisted although they did improve somewhat , once starting steroids .\nOf note , he has an ataxic gait , he has periodic lapses in

for G tube placement are made at this time .\nShe has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .\nShe did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .\nIn the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but

transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\nHe had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .\nHe was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .\nThe patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q's in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.\nOn physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .\nThe cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .\nHe had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\nHe also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB's .\nHis intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .\nHe had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .\nOn day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .\nOn day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .\nTherefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .\nThe patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .\nHowever , he did not keep any of these appointments .\nHe went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .\nOn the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\nHe came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward

revealed the extra ocular movements intact .\nThe pupils equal , round , reactive to light .\nThe oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .\nThere were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .\nThe neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .\nThe carotids were 1+ without bruits .\nThe heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .\nThe lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .\nThe abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .\nThe liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .\nThere was no splenomegaly .\nThe femoral pulses were diminished

electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -15": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nThe patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .\nHe was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .\nNo beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .\nThe patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .\nThis was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\non 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .\nThe left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .\nGiven the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .\nHe was ambulated progressively on the floor .\nA beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .\nThe patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .\nOn 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .\nThis treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .\nThe patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .\nThere were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .\nThe study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .\nThallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .\nThere was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .\nThese images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .\nAfter extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .\nThe patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .\nDr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .\nPreviously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .\nThe importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .\nShe will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .\nThe patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .\nDespite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .\nHe will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .\nCAGHALA UINTEELE , M.D.", "TR -16": "TR  \nyf / bmot", "DD -17": "DD  \n11-3-93", "TD -18": "TD

confirm the presence of Monilia .\nGradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .\nHe was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .\nHe received VP-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg.\nThe only problem was some recurrent nausea .\nThe radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting .\nHis white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because Neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it

\nThis is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .\nMr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .\nHe had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .\nHis course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .\nIn August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .\nHe rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .\nHe was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .\nAn automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .\nHe was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .\nBecause of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .\nMr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .\nHe was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .\nColonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum .\nA perirectal fistula was seen .\nTreatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .\nOn the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .\nHe presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .\nHe was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .\nHypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\nHe is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .", "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION -9": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  \nPhysical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .\nHis CVP was 16 .\nHe was on the balloon pump at the time .\nHis chest was clear anteriorly .\nHis cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .\nNo murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .\nHis abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .\nHis feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .", "LABORATORY DATA -10": "LABORATORY DATA  \nAdmission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .\nThe sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .\nElectrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .\nThere were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .\nThe chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -11": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nMr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .\nHe was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .\nIt was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .\nAfter replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .\nHe did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .\nIt was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .\nHe also remained intubated .\nMr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn 's disease .\nAll of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .\nAs Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .\nHe was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .\nDr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .\nProcainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .\nInitially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .\nAs Mr. Given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .\nThis resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .\nHe was able to get some fluid off as well .\nWith getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .\nHis cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .\nOn 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .\nWith a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .\nThe balloon pump was restored .\nHe was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .\nHe continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .\nSupportive care continued .\nUnfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .\nBroad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .\nMr. Given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize .\nAnother effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .\nHe had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .\nHemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .\nHe did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .\nHis hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .\nHe continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .\nAnother effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .\nThis resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .\nHe did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\nOn 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .\nThe patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .\nHe began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\nThe patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .\nIndicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .\nHe developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .\nCAGHALA R.

Neurological :\nOn admission the patient was intubated and sedated .\nHer sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family .\nA psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on Paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission .\nOn August 29th , Ms. Abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive .\nShe spent several days in the Intensive Care Unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off .\n2. Pulmonary :\nMs. Abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 .\nAfter two weeks of intubation on July 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue .\nOver the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off .\nBy August 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by August 29th .\nAt this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness .\nShe was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the Intensive Care Unit .\nAfter her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on September 16th , 1998 .\nAt the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues .\n3. Cardiovascular :\nMs. Abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of Neo-Synephrine .\nShe was placed on a Swan Gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the Neo-Synephrine by the 22nd of July .\nShe required no further support and had no further issues until August 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit .\nAt this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute .\nA Swan Gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an SVR of 500 .\nShe was supported with Dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the Dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning .\nAfter the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues .\n4. Renal :\nMs. Abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course .\nShe presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular Lasix dosing daily .\nRenal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on August 29th .\nAt this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 .\nAn elevation by Dr. Freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion .\nHer azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation .\nAt the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values .\n5. Gastrointestinal :\nMs. Abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone .\nShe was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without PO intake .\nOn July 25th a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually .\nThese G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held .\nShe was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit .\nAt the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates .\nThis problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\nShe is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly .\nShe has also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse .\nMs. Abreun , from the onset of her stay at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests .\nThese values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal .\nStone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal .\n5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 .\nTo date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative .\nFurther evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient .\n6. Infectious disease :\nMs. Abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course .\nShe ruled out by PPD .\nThe initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin .\nBecause of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection .\nThe course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen days .\nAt this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days .\nShe then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of August 29th .\nON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo / Vanc/Flagyl .\nShortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone .\nAfter a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics .\nOn discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics .\nMs. Abreun entered the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes .\nBecause of the stress of her infection and Intensive Care Unit admission she was requiring sliding scale Insulin for the full course of her hospital stay .\nHer total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with Insulin NPH for better control .\nHer total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units NPH q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars .\nMs. Abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\nHer thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay .\nAt the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 .\nMore active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately .\nShe has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d .\nHowever , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 .\nHer discharge medication will include Synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely .", "IN SUMMARY -17": "IN SUMMARY  \nMs. Abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection .\nOver the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound .\nHer course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week .\nHer course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy .\nCurrently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated .\nHer wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .", "CONDITION ON DISCHARGE -18": "CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  \nStable with issues resolving .", "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE -19": "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE  \nHeparin 5,000 units sub q b.i.d.\nPrilosec 20 milligrams per G tube q day .\nPaxil 10 milligrams per G tube q.h.s.\nMilk of Magnesia 30 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\nLotrimin cream b.i.d. to effected areas .\nNystatin powder b.i.d. to effected areas .\nLasix 20 milligrams intravenous q day .\nSynthroid 0.3 milligrams per G tube q day .\nReglan 10 milligrams per G tube t.i.d.\nPeri-Colace 15 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\nGlutamine 10 grams diluted as necessary per G tube t.i.d.\nAtivan 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligrams per G tube or sublingual q 6 hours whenever necessary .\nInsulin sliding scale as follows ;

marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .\nThis was considered her culprit lesion .\nThis was considered too high risk for angioplasty

that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .\nShe would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .\nThis was intermittent .\nThe P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .\nThe patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .\nIt was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .\nHer pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .\nShe was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .\nWhen her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .\nCarotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .\nHe felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .\nFor this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .\nOn August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .\nThere was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .\nIt just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .\nShe tolerated this well .\nHer medications were resumed .\nShe ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure

at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .\nThe patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .\nHowever , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .\nThe patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .\nThe etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .\nThe patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .\nAn attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .\n5 ) Infectious disease :\nThe patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .\nUrinalysis demonstrated a

She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .\nFor this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .\nHer blood pressure responds well to this .\nOtherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .\nThe patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .\nThis has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .\nDr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .\nThe aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .\nThey elected not to inject it with thrombin .\nThey asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .\nThey have opted for conservative management given the size .\n3. Respiratory .\nAt the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .\nShe seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .\nHer chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .\nHer right lung field is clear .\nHer tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .\nShe will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .\nWe had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .\nWith the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .\nHer oxygen saturation has always been good .\n4. GI .\nThe patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .\nThis is her goal .\nShe tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .\nLast week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .\nStool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .\nThese have all been negative .\nWe believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .\nSince her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .\nShe has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .\n5. GU .\nThe patient has had hypernatremia .\nShe is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .\nWe believe her to still be total body overloaded .\nOver the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .\nWe also have been diuresing her with Bumex .\nThis seems to trend her sodium down .\nThis will need to be monitored closely .\nHer BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .\n6. Heme .\nAs stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .\nShe had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .\nBefore we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .\nShe had no problems with this .\nAt the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .\nI stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .\nWe have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .\nTherefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .\nShe does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .\nShe has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .\n7. ID .\nAt the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .\nShe is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .\nInterestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .\nThis is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .\nWe do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .\nShe is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .\nHer Foley was changed the day before discharge .\n8.

, by May 1998 , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time .\nMammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy .\nAn ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm .\nThe patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma .\nShe , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( November 1998 ) .\nThe final results from pathology revealed a very large tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin .\nThe tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion .\nER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K-617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase .\nDNA content was deployed .\nOn examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma .\nSubsequent to surgery , she had an uncomplicated recovery .\nShe then went on to dose-intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well .\nRestaging revealed no evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high-dose cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization .\nLeukophoresis went well and stem cell yields were excellent .\nTherefore , she is being admitted for

initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of DEP therapy for pulmonary involvement .\nIn the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .\nIn early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .\nIn 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .\nIn early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. Azel Hibbskays and finished this in March of this year .\nCT imaging at that time was negative for disease .\nIn April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .\nThereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .\nMost recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital on 06/16/00 .\nThat hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .\nHe was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .\nIt was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .\nFinally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for

Medical Center .\nAs the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .\nThere was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .\nAt the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .\nSubsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .\nGiven all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .\nThe patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .\nThe patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .\nHe did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .", "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY -10": "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  \n1.

superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -18": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nThe patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .\nOver the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .\nThe patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .\nThe patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .\nAfter lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .\nThis was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .\nThe patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .\nThe procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .\nThe aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .\nThe cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .\nThe graft used was a homograft .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .\nThe immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\nThere he continued to be hemodynamically stable .\nOf note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .\nIn the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .\nOn that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .\nA number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .\nThe patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\nAt this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .\nThe Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .\nOver the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .\nThe patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .\nThe patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .\nSubsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .\nThe patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .\nAs per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .\nHowever on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .\nGiven this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .\nThe patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .\nThis was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .\nAt the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .\nHe was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .\nHe continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .\nOn postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .\nSubsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .\nThe patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .\nThe patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .\nThese drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .\nPrior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\nThe patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .\nAs a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .\nThe patient 's condition continued to be improved .\nGiven this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .\nIn consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .", "CONDITION ON DISCHARGE -19": "CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  \nGood .", "DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS -20":

part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .\nBy discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .\nThe patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .\nRepeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .\nAt the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .\n2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :\nThe patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+

a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .\nThe opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .\nShe required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .\nDuring the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her

pump , intubated .\nHis peak CPK was in the 3000 range .\nThe patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin .\nHe underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion .\nIn addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis .\nIt was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis .\nIn addition , the patient had confusion and delirium .\nHead CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe .\nHe was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol .\nIn addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented .\nThe patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex .\nThis was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly .\nHe tolerated it well .\nThe ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission .\nThe patient was transferred to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\nHe had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation .\nHe was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder .\nHe is followed by Dr. Squithsherl in this regard .\nAt the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy .\nHe has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure .\nOf note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis .\nElectronically Signed RIETHERN N BREUN , M.D. 02/17/2002 11:29\n_____________________________ RIETHERN N BREUN , M.D.", "TR -17": "TR  \nfb", "DD -18": "DD  \n02/06/2002", "TD -19":

rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .\nSurgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump .\nCentral access was gained and a chest x-ray was done which showed no pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as NG tube .\nHe was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .\nAtropine one amp was given .\nAt this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .\nThere was a question of fleeting T waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead EKG .\nAt this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .\nAt this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .\nThe rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.\nThe patient was without respirations or blood pressure .\nThe family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .\nAutopsy was requested , however , the patient 's family will not give us

, 1992 .\nLater , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .\nThe left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .\nThe aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .\nThere was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .\nThe left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .\nThere was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .\nA Persantine Thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .", "LABORATORY DATA -10": "LABORATORY DATA  \npotassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .\nThis was of uncertain significance .\nThe hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -11": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nThe patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .\nOver the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .\nCoincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .\nGiven the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 .\nAt the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .\nThere was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .\nLeft ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .\nThere was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .\nThe anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .\nThe aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .\nA dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .\nA large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .\nThe posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .\nThe left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .\nThe saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .\nThe saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .\nThe saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .\nCertainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .\nThese findings were reviewed with Dr. Patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. Breun 's management .\nHis advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .\nPercutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .\nIt is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. Breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .\nHe seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .\nHe is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .\nWe will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. Wierst and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .\nETHELAN KOTEFYFECHIRD , M.D.", "TR -12": "TR  \ngo / bmot", "DD -13": "DD  \n4/4/93", "TD -14": "TD  \n04/06/93", "CC -15": "\n[ report_end ]\n</TEXT>"},

with chills .\nThere were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .\nShe was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .\nBecause of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to O Center in Sondibrid Ey on 6/20 , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .\nBlood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .\nHer antibiotics were appropriately changed

Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .\nHer antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .\nCardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .\nThere was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .\nShe was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .\nThe patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .\nShe was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .\nThere was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .\nIn addition , she was evaluated by the Sileyer Medical Center and there was no evidence of active dental infection .\nShe had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .\nBecause of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .\nHer temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .\nTowards the end of June , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .\nA rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .\nOn 7/13 , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .\nShe was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .\nHer cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .\nAfter considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient 's care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .\nAlso , no source for sepsis had been found .\nBecause of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone 's opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .\nAccordingly , she was taken to the operating room on 7/21/93 .\nDuring her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .\nShe , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .\nHer valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .\nIt was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .\nHer valve was replaced with a St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .\nShe weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .\nShe was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .\nIn the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .\nThe sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .\nShe was returned to the operating room on 07/22 and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .\nHer sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .\nWith clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .\nShe subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .\nShe remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .\nDespite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .\nAfter consultation with the

resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .\nThroughout the hospitalization she remained fatigued and lethargic , resisting mobilization .\nShe had no further neurologic symptoms .\nPost cath she developed contrast induced acute renal failure , with peak creat of 2.3 .\nShe was seen in consultation by the Renal service who followed along closely .\nEventually she had renal MRA which was reported as showing severe right renal artery stenosis .\nIn order to evaluate this , on 10/21 she underwent renal MRA which showed only moderate right renal artery stenosis that was non-obstructive .\nFollowing the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .\nShe underwent abdominal CT which was negative for retroperitoneal bleed .\nThere was no evidence of GI bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .\nShe was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .\nThis echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .\nShe was seen in consultation by PT , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .\nShe was found to have a 4 x normal risk of falling , which was felt to be significant .\nShe however is at increased risk for further embolic phenomenon with atrial fibrillation .\nShe was maintained on Fragmin and will be considered for lowdose Coumadin once the Plavix is finished in a month if her gait and strength

frontal lobe .\nAs noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative Clostridium difficile , a weakly positive D-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -13": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nThe patient 's presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer 's of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .\nWork up included from a neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .\nIn concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .\nAn lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .\nIn addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .\nIn addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .\nFor her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .\nFor her FEN , the patient was able to take PO 's and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take PO 's with one to one supervision .\nFor prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .\nFrom an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of 08/10 through 08/12/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .\nNo obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .\nExcellent suggestions from Dr. Pa of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient 's weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .\nHowever , these antibodies were both within normal limits .\nThe patient 's mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from 08/10 through 08/12 and was markedly improved on 08/13/2002 , compared with the day of admission .\nHowever , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .\nThe nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .\nOn the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .\nCA-125 levels were within normal limits .\nWe entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .\nWe will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .\nPending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the Termarimed pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .\nLENNI E.

only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .\nCultures were taken and he was sent out .\nOn 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .\nHe was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .\nReview of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .\nHis oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .", "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY -3":

of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .\nIn terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .\nHe was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .\nThe patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .\nHe was given supplemental oxygen .\nIn terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .\nTiters for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .\nStool was sent for ova and parasites .\nGastrointestinal was consulted .\nInitially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .\nHowever , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .\nActually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient 's respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .\nOn 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .\nHe was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .\nAlso of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .\nHowever , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .\nThe patient 's abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .\nThe patient 's liver function tests appeared to improve .\nThe patient 's penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .\nOn 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .\nNo other cultures grew out and the patient 's clinical status deteriorated .\nThe patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .\nHe required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .\nFortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .\nHowever , the patient 's respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .\nPatient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .\nThe patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .\nThese were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .\nThey felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .\nBone marrow biopsy was not attempted .\nDiscussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .\nDue to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .\nThis was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .\nPatient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.",

has a history of urinary tract infection .\nShe has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .\nIn 01/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness .\nThere was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .\nThe patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .\nShe also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .\nShe also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .\nOn arrival to the Ph University Of Medical Center the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .\nHowever , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .", "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION -13": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  \nOn physical examination her pulse was 55 .\nHer systolic blood pressure was 110 .\nShe appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .\nHer lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .\nHer cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .\nHer abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .", "LABORATORY DATA -14": "LABORATORY DATA  \nLaboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .\nBUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .\nA chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .\nA KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .\nAn electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .", "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT -15": "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  \nThe patient was admitted to Goman 25 where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .\nA urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .\nA head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .\nThere was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .\nThe patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient 's diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .\nThe patient had been followed by Dr. Friednantflirt of the Ph University Of Medical Center .\nAt that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .\nThe recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .\nOn the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .\nShe was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .\nHowever , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .\nHer eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .\nThe patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .\nThe patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .\nA cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .\nThere was trace mitral regurgitation .\nMultiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .\nThere was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .\nThe patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .\nShe was also continued to be hydrated .\nHer blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .\nAfter careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .\nThe patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .\nHer BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .\nDigoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .\nThe patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .\nHer ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .\nIt was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .\nHowever , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .\nNevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .\nMajor consideration toward the end of the patient 's hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .\nInitially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .\nHowever , with the assistance of the patient 's granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .\nThe patient 's granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .\nI discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .\nThe patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .\nNevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .\nThe patient will be transferred tomorrow to Naplesvillechaelty .\nI will get in touch with Dr. Areas and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .\nMy direct pager is 935-131-3314 .\nTAMYRCLEO KOTE , M.D.", "TR -16": "TR  \ngqx", "DD -17": "DD  \n07/27/1999", "TD -18": "\n07/27/1999 7:52 P\ncc :\nTAMYRCLEO NADON KOTE , M.D. RYNVI A AREAS , M.D.\n[

PT and PTT were 13.3 and 23.5 respectively .\nUA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nBy systems -\n1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .\nExtraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .\nEGD was performed .\nSubsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .\nThere was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .\nThe patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately 9/22/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .\nThe patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .\nThe patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .\nOther GI issues include the patient 's hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .\n2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .\nBecause of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .\n3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .\nA swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .\nSeveral NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .\nThe patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .\nHe was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient 's mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .\nOther options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient 's poor prognosis for the future .\nThe family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient 's nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .\nIt is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .\n4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .\nThe patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .\nThe chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .\nHowever , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .\nThe patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .\nNo organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .\n5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .\nIt was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .\nHe had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .\nThe patient continued to be asymptomatic .\n6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .\nThe patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .\nThese issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .\nPsychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .\n7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .\nIt was decided the patient 's code status would not be DNR , DNI .\n8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .\nHe underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9/21/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a GI bleed .\nLaboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .\nCBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .\nThe white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .\nThe last PT and PTT on 09/26/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .\nThe last UA and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on 09/27/93 .\nThe patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on 09/27/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .\nA faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .", "OPERATIVE PROCEDURES -9": "OPERATIVE PROCEDURES  \nExtraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on 9/21/93 .", "COMPLICATIONS -10": "COMPLICATIONS  \n1) Aspiration pneumonia .\n2) GI bleed .\n3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .", "DISPOSITION -11": "DISPOSITION  ", "CONDITION ON DISCHARGE -12": "CONDITION ON DISCHARGE  \nThe patient is stable on discharge .\nThe patient is to be transferred to Paw.ryfear Medical Center for further care including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and further nutritional support .", "DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS -13": "DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS  \nPepcid 20 mg po IV b.i.d. for history of gastritis and GI bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.

a CT scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .\nThere was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .\nThere was no evidence of perforation on the CT scan .\nThe patient went to the operating room on the evening of 03/13/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .\nThis was taken down and the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .\nThere was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .\nPostoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .\nHowever by the mid morning of the 14th of March , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .\nThe patient was invasively lined with a Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .\nAt this point the patient 's creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .\nThe patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for the prospect of sepsis given his neutropenia and previous splenectomy and then an echocardiogram was performed to assess left ventricular function .\nThe transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .\nThe Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .\nOn 03/14/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .\nUpon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .\nHowever prior to this it was also noted that the patient 's scrotum was necrotic .\nAn incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .\nTherefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .\nIn the abdomen the patient 's retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled-off .\nThe anastomosis appeared intact on examination .\nUpon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic-like picture and was maintained on Neo-Synephrine .\nHe was hydrated vigorously .\nIt should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have a pancreatitis by enzymes .\nThis was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .\nThe patient 's urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .\ntherefore the patient went back to the operating room on 03/15/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .\nFurther debridement was undertaken .\nThe patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .\nThe patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .\nOn 03/16/00 the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .\nUnfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .\nThe patient 's family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of 03/16/00 .\nThe patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of 03/17/00 .", "DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE -11": "DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE  \nExpired .\nDictated By :\nEEEN L.

anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .\nThis was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .\nShe received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .\n2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in

platelet count .\nA clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .\nShe did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued

And Medical Center .\nAt that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .\nThis bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .\nIn 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .\nA workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .\nAccording to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .\nHe was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .\nHe has been on Decadron since 08/94 .\nAbout two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .\nHe also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .\nHe stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .\nAn MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .\nThere was evidence of cord compression .\nThe patient 's Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .\nHowever , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .\nOver the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient 's right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .\nHe has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .\nHe also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .\nAt the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .\nHe was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .\nBlood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .\nBlood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\nHe was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .\nA Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all

right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .\nThere was no CSF density .\nThese findings were consistent with the cord compression .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -10": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nBy problems -\n1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :\nThe patient 's clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .\nBlood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .\nThere were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\nThe organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .\nHe was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism 's susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .\nHe was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .\nThe Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .\nIn addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .\nVancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .\nHe was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .\nHe is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .\nThese dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .\nOf note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .\nThe plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .\nAs mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .\nThe cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\nThe patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .\nHe was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .\nHe has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .\nAn echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .\nThe patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\nHe has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .\nThe plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .\n3) ONCOLOGY :\nThe patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .\nHe has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .\nThe plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .\nThe patient 's lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .\n4) NEUROLOGIC :\nAs mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .\nHe was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.\nHis neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .\nHis Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .\nHis Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .\n5) BLOOD SUGARS :\nThe patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .\nHe has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .\nThe plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .\n6) RESPIRATORY :\nHe initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .\nHowever , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .\nHe can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .\n7) NUTRITION :\nThe patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .\nHe has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .\nHe should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .\n8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :\nBoth of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .\nHis PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .\nThis has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .\nWe have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .\nHe also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .\nThrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .", "DISPOSITION -11": "DISPOSITION  ", "DISCHARGE

.\nHe was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms .\nHe was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .\nThe patient 's mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full Arnsperni Health services .\nBedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration .\nHe did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued .\nThus , he was considered ready for

9-8-94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here-transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the EXWAGH9T protocol .\nHis operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .\nHe then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .\nDuring this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .\nDespite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .\nAn X-ray at the time revealed free air .\nThe patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .\nHe was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .\nHe therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation .\nThe subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .\nThe patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated .\nA renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .\nIt was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .\nWith just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .\nAt the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .\nIt is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .\nPostoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .\nHe ruled out for

origin , without history of asthma .\nHer steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .\nThey felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .\nShe had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .\nRoom air arterial blood gas

without evidence of tamponade .\nShe should have a follow-up echocardiogram .\nEchocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient 's cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .\nThoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .\nShe should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .\nShe underwent her CT scan .\nThis showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .\nPulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .\nChemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .\nShe

consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .\nThey therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .\nThe patient 's shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .\nHer cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .\nCardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .\nThey therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .\nShe had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .\nThe Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes

diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .\nOver the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation

TREATMENT -17": "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  \n1) NEUROLOGY :\nThe patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .\nHe had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .\nIt did , however , show diffuse slowing .\nHe was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .\nHis hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .\nHe continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .\nHe did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .\nHis diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .\nIt was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .\nIt was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson 's disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .\nHe had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .\nThis showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .\nIn addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .\nHowever , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .\nThe etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\nHis electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .\nHe was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .\nHe did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .\nThat was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small \" leaflet \" .\nHe remained chest pain free throughout his admission .\n3) PULMONARY :\nAfter his initial intubation he remained quite stable .\nHe was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .\nHowever , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .\n4) HEMATOLOGY :\nHe had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .\nHis anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .\nIt was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .\nHe did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .\nIt was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .\n5) GASTROINTESTINAL :\nHe was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .\nThus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .\nIn discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .\nHowever , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .\nThe family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\nStable .\nDOCTOR 'S DISCHARGE ORDERS :\nThe patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .\nThe patient is to follow up with Dr. Ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .", "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE

tumor along with a laminectomy .\nPostoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .\nHe was extubated on postoperative day number one .\nHis neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .\nHe was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .\nHe was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .\nHe noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .\nOn postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .\nHe vomited once and had intermittent headaches .\nA head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .\nA lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .\nA culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .\nHe was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .\nHe was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .\nA video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .\nBecause of continuing complaints by Mr. Marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .\nHe underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on Feb 04 , 1997 .\nPrior to admission Mr. Marker had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .\nAfter conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. Marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .\nIt was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .\nHis visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .\nHis lumbar drain was removed after five days .\nHe was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .\nHe is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .",

PRESENT ILLNESS  \nThe patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .\nPatient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows :\nIn 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in Hispit , Delaware .\nSince that time the patient has been treated medically .\nIn 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .\nOn 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at Retelk County Medical Center .\nEchocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .\nConsequently the patient was started on Coumadin .\nCatheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .\nCoronaries were completely normal .\nConsequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .\nIn the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .\nHemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .\nPulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .\nRepeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .\nFurthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .\nConsequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .\nThe patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to Souland in Nixmont Bovo with increasing congestive heart failure .\nAt that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .\nBy report , in the interim since discharge from Retelk County Medical Center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .\nDring this hospitalization at Hahkellrick Hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .\nShe was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .\nShe was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .\nShe was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to Retelk County Medical Center for further evaluation .\nThe patient was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .\nThe patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .\nIt was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .\nFurthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the Alllo Eino Hospital which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .\nNote , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty .\nOn 02/22/94 an EPS study was performed .\nThe patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .\nConsequently AICD placement was recommended .\nConsequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 .\nNote , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .\nConsequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .\nNote , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .\nCultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .\nThus , AICD placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .\nThere were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .\nBy 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .\nAt this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 .\nIt was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to Vonamemp , LA via plane by herself .\nThis was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B

Studies .\nHis cardiac risk factors include :\nhypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .\nHe has a history of chest pain and in January 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at Ph University Of Medical Center which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .\nHe subsequently had an echocardiogram in December 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .\nHe subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in February 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .\nIn December 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .\nHe was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .\nHe underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. Slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful .\nHe was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .\nOn 9/2/98 he was admitted to Cay Memorial Hospital Of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .\nHe had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .\nAn echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .\nHe was discharged home but returned on 9/13/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .\nHe was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .\nHe denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .\nHe continued to

intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .\nThere were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .", "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT -13": "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  \nThe patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .\nGiven his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .\nHis initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .\nHe was seen by Nnoatal Hospital Center who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .\nAccordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .\nHis right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .\nHe had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .\nHis left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .\nThe patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 .\nThere was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .\nMapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .\nRadiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .\nThere were no complications .\nFollowing the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .\nHe still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .\nIn following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .\nThere were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .\nHe also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .\nFollowing the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .\nHis Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .\nAfter the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .\nHis INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .\nFinally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .\nAccordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .\nHe did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .\nFinally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .\nGiven his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .", "CONDITION ON DISCHARGE -14":

course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on November 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .\nPatient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .\nOn November 30 , a family meeting with patient 's daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. Tomedankell Bile , attending physician , Dr. Mellerny Close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient 's critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .\nDecision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient 's comfort .\nPentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient 's comfort .\nDNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .\nThe patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .\nTylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .\nSuch measures have been continued through December 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time .\nThis interim dictation to be followed by an addendum detailing end of

epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .\nShe was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .\nDue to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .\nShe was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .\nThe patient was sedated .\nDirect laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted .\nShe was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .\nHer initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .\nAt the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .\nHer episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .\nShe had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .\nShe was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .\nEKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .\nShe continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .\nHer blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .\nShe was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .\nShe went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .\nShe continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .\nHer edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema .\nOn 4/5/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .\nShe was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .\nExamination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .\nOtherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .\nOf note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .\nOnce the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .\nTube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .\nAfter extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .\nAgain , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .\nO2 saturations looked good .\nIt was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .\nShe was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .\nShe was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .\nHer white counts came down .\nBlood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .\nShe had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .\nCardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .\nUnfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .\nNonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .\nHer mental status began to clear under the family 's request .", "DISPOSITION -12": "DISPOSITION  \nOn 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .\nOur plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .\nShe , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .\nIf she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .\nDischarge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d.

Virginia for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .\nMr. Leach has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .\nHe was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in August of l988 .\nHe was treated at that time with TPA .\nA subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .\nHis ejection fraction was in the mid-50's.\nBecause of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .\nHe did well until he developed recurrent angina in March of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .\nHe again did well until approximately late l992 .\nSince that time , he has had multiple admissions to George'sdgot Medical Center with recurrent chest pain .\nHe has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .\nHe has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40's and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in August of l994 at 31% .\nHe was admitted to George'sdgot Medical Center with a typical episode of this discomfort in October of l994 .\nHe was transferred at that time to the Ph University Of Medical Center .\nThat was his first Ph University Of Medical Center admission .\nBecause of Mr. Leach 's history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .\nHis angiograms from Morehegron Valley Hospital from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .\nHe was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on October 13 , 1994 .\nThere he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .\nRepeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .\nHe then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .\nSpecifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .\nFollowing the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .\nHe had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .\nHowever , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .\nIt was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .\nHe was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .\nFollowing that admission in October he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .\nStarting in the October of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .\nThis occurred at rest and with exercise .\nHe had multiple admissions to the Morehegron Valley Hospital once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .\nHis medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .\nHis most recent admission to the Morehegron Valley Hospital is on April 5 , of 1994 .\nHe had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .\nBecause of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center on 4-9-94 .\nHis medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .\nThere is no history of drug abuse or smoking .\nOf note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20's .\nThere is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .\nOf note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .\nHis medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .", "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION -4": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  \nHe looked generally well .\nHis blood pressure l60/90 .\nHis heart rate was 88 .\nHis jugular venous pressure was normal .\nHis chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .\nHis abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .\nHis femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .\nHe had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .\nHis initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .\nPotassium of 3.2 .\nNormal chloride and CO2 .\nHis BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .\nGlucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .\nHis fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .\nHis liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .\nHis hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .\nHis sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -5": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nthe primary concern upon Mr. Leach 's transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .\nIt was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .\nTo that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on 4-10-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .\nThe right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .\nThe left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .\nCoronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from October of l994 .\nThat is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .\nLeft ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .\nImpression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .\nHe was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr. Lato Tikfreierm of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .\nAfter an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. Leach 's platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .\nSpecifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .\nThis was utilized in making some changes in Mr. Leach 's regiment .\nSpecifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.\nRepeat in vitro testing of Mr. Leach 's platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .\nWhile in the hospital , Mr. Leach continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .\nThese were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .\nThere were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .\nBecause of the ongoing nature of his pain .\nMultiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .\nHe was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .\nHe was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .\nAmlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .\nThe rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .\nProtein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .\nProtein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .\nPlasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .\nFactor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .\nThrombin time and repalase time were normal .\nIt was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .\nHis anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .\nHis APC resistance was normal .\nHe was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .\nRheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .\nHe had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .\nIt was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .\nHis compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .\nBecause of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .\nTo evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .\nPrior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on May 13 .\nThat study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .\nOn the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .\nThat was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .\nThis produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .\nHe was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .\nHe once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .\nThis encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .\nAfter extended discussions with pain service , Mr. Leach was brought back down to the pain clinic on October 27 .\nThere a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .\nOnce again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .\nThe catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .\nAfter extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .\nTherefore , on October 27 , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. Aalv Sctroi .\nHe tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .\nHe had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on May 27 , 1995 .", "DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS -6": "DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS  \nTiclopodine 500 mg. p.o.b.i.d.

and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .\nShe was subsequently referred to Dr. Riode Zetllille for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .\nThe patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on 12/31/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .\nThe patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .\nSince the patient 's last admission she gives no

intraoperative complications .\nShe was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .\nThe patient 's procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .\nThe patient remained intubated postoperatively .\nShe had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .\nOn postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .\nEpidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .\nThe patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .\nSerum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .\nThe patient 's oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .\nShe was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .\nThis was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .\nNeurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .\nLaboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels .\nNeurological consultation was obtained .\nIt was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .\nThe epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .\nMRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .\nThe patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .\nShe was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .\nContinued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .\nHer ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .\nSocial Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .\nThe patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .\nThe patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .\nThe patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .\nShe was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .\nAdditional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center .\nIt

obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .\nIt appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .\nThe General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on 05/08 a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .\nPathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .\nThe patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .\nHowever , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .\nIt was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .\nAfter discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .\nThe patient 's subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .\nShe complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .\nAs she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .\nThe best course of action was

procedure had been done with intraoperative monitoring , and every time we made an attempt to dissect tumor away from the nerve roots we achieved considerable stimulation of the lower extremity muscles .\nWe felt that the way the tumor was invading and wrapped around all of the nerves and sharing a common blood supply with them , that it would not be possible to achieve any form of significant surgical decompression or removal of tumor without leading to a substantial neurological deficit .\nTherefore , the operation was terminated by placing a large dural graft to provide intradural room with the idea that postoperatively the lesion would be treated with radiation therapy .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well .\nThe postoperative course was without complication .\nPain was managed initially with an intravenous patient controlled analgesia system .\nThe wound healed without difficulty and the drain was removed .\nThe patient began to ambulate .\nHis leg

"HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT  \nMr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .\nHe underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .\nHowever , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .\nHe had normal cervical vertebral arteries .\nTranscranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .\nThe proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .\nOver the course of the first hospital day , the patient 's exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .\nHe had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .\nA computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .\nMRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .\nBecause of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .\nHis systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .\nHowever , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .\nThis strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .\nWhile in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .\nHe also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .\nIn terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .\nHe was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .\nI should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .\nHe had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .\nAdditionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .\nHe was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .\nAt this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .\nWe anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .\nHe will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po

we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\nWe went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\nThat has been stable .\nThe patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\nA renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\nWe proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\nWe had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\nIn addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\nSo that has really improved .\nWe suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\nSo we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\nHer INR is 2.3 .\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\nOther major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\nWe put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\nSo on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\nIf needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\nThe patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\nShe is also a little dry .\nThe patient is on oxygen .\nEver since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\nWe would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\nThe complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .", "DISPOSITION -10": "DISPOSITION  \nDischarge medications -

similar to aparonychia .\nHe had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft .\nHe also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally .\nHe was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass .\nThe patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of Dr. Area 's office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking .\nHe has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state .\nHe had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around

.\nHis rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the Tocon Hospital the previous week .\nHe has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet .\nHis pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally .", "LABORATORY DATA -9": "LABORATORY DATA  \nHis BUN and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count .\nHe has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -10": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nDr. Area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that I would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis .\nAfter discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm .\nEP to FE under general endotracheal anesthesia .\nThere was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved .\nSuperficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded .\nThere was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis .\nThe profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes .\nIt was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked .\nThe patient postoperatively did quite well .\nHe had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and Silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill .\nHis groin incision was healing nicely and he was on Heparin , being converted to Coumadin .\nBecause of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged .\nThe orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to Frontera 34 to ensure that this would be performed properly .\nNo cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged .\nDespite loading him on Coumadin , his prothrombin time and INR increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the 18th of December .\nI had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes .\nI explained to the patient that because of his early discharge I would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment

normal right and left hepatic arteries ,\n3. an enlarged liver with necrotic regions consistent with known colon metastatic tumors .\nThe patient was subsequently brought to the Operating Room where she underwent a hepatic right trisegmentectomy .\nThe operative findings were notable for a softball sized tumor in the right lobe of the liver , as well as multiple smaller tumor nodules .\nThe left lateral segment was grossly free of tumor .\nThe intraoperative course was notable for acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the fifties .\nThe patient received 21 liters of lactated Ringers solution , 16 units of packed red blood cells , and 21 units of fresh frozen plasma , and 12 units of platelets .\nThere were 5300 cc given via the Cellsaver .\nThe patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\nHowever , over the ensuing hours , the patient continued to have ongoing blood loss with hypotension .\nThe decision was made to return the patient to the operating room .\nThe patient was then returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for bleeding .\nThe operative findings were notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava .\nThe patient was returned again to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\nHowever , again the patient continued to demonstrate ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirements .\nThe patient required blood pressure support with pressors .\nDue to output of approximately 950 cc on placement of a right chest tube , the decision was made to return tothe operating room for exploration for bleeding .\nThe patient was therefore explored through a right thoracoabdominal incision .\nThe abdomen was again notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava , a notable coagulopathy , and therefore , the abdomen was packed and the patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\nHowever , over the subsequent 8-10 hours , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure despite maximal support with pressor agents including phenylephrine , norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine .\nThe patient continued to require transfusions .\nThe patient 's oxygenation became increasingly difficult , as the chest X-rays demonstrated marked pulmonary edema .\nThe ventilator settings demonstrated elevating peak inspiratory pressures up to 75 millimeters .\nThe urine output dropped dramatically , and the patient was treated with Lasix and Mannitol for an attempt at forced diuresis .\nAs the patient 's hemodynamic parameters demonstrated a narrow pulse pressure and rapidly elevated pulmonary artery pressures , the decision was made to perform echocardiogram to rule out potential paracardial tamponade .\nThe study was considered to be inadequate , and it was unable definitively rule out the presence of such tamponade .\nDespite maximal support with pressor agents , mechanical ventilation , and ongoing transfusion with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells , and a Protamine for treatment of the coagulopathy , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure , and subsequently expired with a cessation of heart rate and blood pressure at 11:20 p.m. on 7-29-94

.\nThe coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease .\nAn echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis .\nHe had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation .\nAfter the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface QRS configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously .\nThe patient was discharged while on procainamide and Coumadin .\nOn March 8 , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain .\nThe patient was admitted to an outside hospital in Xingwa Moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated .\nThe tachycardia had not responded to

Unit .\nThe patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia .\nIntravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia .\nOn March 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study .\nDuring the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex .\nPace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle .\nAfter mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times .\nAfter radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred .\nHowever , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol .\nSince the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient .\nThe patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy .\nOn March 17 , the patient was taken to the Pacemaker Laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( CPI Endotak C 0074 ) was placed .\nThen , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a Ventak PRX model 1705 automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator system was implanted .\nThe defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 20 joules on several consecutive attempts .\nThe patient 's postoperative course was uneventful .\nOn March 19 , the patient was taken back to the Electrophysiology Laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed .\nUnder brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing .\nThis was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock .\nThree zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator .\nFor tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed .\nFor tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed .\nFor tachycardias faster than 175 beats per minute , cardioversion and defibrillation was programmed .\nVVI pacing at 40 beats per minute was also programmed .\nThe patient felt good on the morning of March 20 .\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on the regimen described above .\nHe will have his prothrombin

of 30 degrees by postoperative day number eight .\nHis wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .\nHowever , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and Endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .\nHis hemoglobin A1C levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .\nHe was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .\nIt was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .\nHe also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus Neurology was consulted and EMG 's were performed which were normal .\nHis neurologist was contacted , Dr. Cap , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .\nFurther work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .\nThus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good

Cliffestreukote was admitted on the night of the 20th , for obvious right lung pneumonia .\nThe differential diagnosis included several organisms as outlined below .\n(1) Pneumonia .\nHe was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days .\nThe pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia .\nHe was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , Clindamycin , and Ciprofloxacin .\nThe ration off for the utilization of the Ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to Erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for Legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities .\nHowever , he was isolated , and three AFB smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis .\nIn addition , sputum induction was performed for Pneumocystis , which was negative .\nHis urinary Legionella antigen subsequently came back negative .\nHowever , this test is only 85-95% sensitive for Legionella pneumophila , type I , which is the subtype that causes some 80% of legionnaires disease .\nHowever , the Legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other Legionella species that may be involved in Legionella pneumonia .\nTherefore , the Ciprofloxacin was continued .\nIn addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission .\nAfter admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , Mr. Cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic .\nHowever , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission .\nBecause of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) .\nTherefore , an evaluation by the Pulmonary Team of the Tonwe Hospital , as well as a sputum cytology and chest CT scan , were all obtained .\nThe chest CT scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae .\nHis sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge .\nThe Pulmonary Team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .\nTherefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease .\nDespite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , Mr. Cliffestreukote will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course .\nIt should be noted , that Clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea .\nAdditionally , when switched to oral medication , Mr. Cliffestreukote was switched to Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his Ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d.\n(2) Hypertension .\nWhile in the hospital , Mr. Cliffestreukote was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and Verapamil SR , and required no additional medication .\n(3) Hyponatremia .\nWhile in the hospital , persistent type of natremia was noted on the patient 's Profile 7 labs .\nIt was felt that this was due largely to his pulmonary disease , and would resolve with the resolution of his intrapneumonic process .\nWhile in the hospital , there were no complications .", "DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS -19": "DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS  \nAugmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. for eleven more days ,

infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 .\nThe patient had an extensive workup for

hypotension .\nHer initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge .\nIn the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema .\nThe patient auto-diuresed spontaneously .\nSubsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray .\nBecause of the patient 's significant smoking history , chest PT was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis .\nHowever , the chest CT showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes .\nThe patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints .\nPrior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest CT included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis .\nBecause the patient had no

increasing chest pain and shortness of breath .\nHe has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries .\nHis first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by Dr. Riez .\nHe had LIMA to the LAD and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery .\nHe presented with angina and had an occluded LAD and severe circumflex and right coronary disease .\nHe had normal left ventricular function .\nHe did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in March of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded .\nThe left main was normal .\nThe LAD was also occluded .\nThe circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches .\nThe LIMA to the LAD was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the LAD .\nThe snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .\nFor this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by Dr. Riez .\nHe had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .\nHe had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the LAD bypassing the mid lesion .\nThe LIMA was left from the first surgery .\nHe did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .\nHe had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm S660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .\nHe did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling .\nHe therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization .", "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY -11": "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  \nHis past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc .\nHe also has had cataract repairs .", "FAMILY HISTORY -12": "FAMILY HISTORY  \nHe has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary

.\nHematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -17": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nThe patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory .\nThere , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the RV marginal and the right-sided PDA was patent .\nThe LAD was occluded and the LIMA to the proximal LAD was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the LAD and that was also patent .\nThe vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .\nThe culprit territory was the distal left-sided PDA coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis .\nThis was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion .\nIt was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically .\nLeft ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function .\nHe tolerated the procedure well .\nHe was monitored for the day .\nHe ambulated without difficulty .\nHe was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at Sko Gerb Timp Valley Health and at Middso Memorial Hospital 's .\nHe will remain on beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , statins , aspirin and Plavix

GI :\nThe patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .\nGI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .\nFinally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .\nThe EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .\nHer stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .\n4.

Derm :\nSeveral days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .\nShe was started on some Miconazole

small bowel with no air fluid levels .\nIn addition , an ultrasound was performed of the right lower quadrant which showed no evident appendix .\nThe pelvis and pelvic structures were normal and there was a normal gallbladder and kidneys seen on the right .\nChest x-ray was unremarkable , urinalysis was negative , and beta HCG was negative .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -15": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nThe patient was admitted to the hospital with a principle diagnosis of likely perforated appendicitis .\nShe was admitted and put on intravenous antibiotics with plan of obtaining an abdominopelvic CT scan .\nOn the day of admission , an abdominopelvic CAT scan was obtained which showed dilated loops of fluid filled bowel and colon in the right lower quadrant .\nThe colon was decompressed distally and there was no contrast seen in the lower intestine .\nThis was thought to represent at least a partial small bowel obstruction or possibly an ileus .\nThere were some bubbles of free air which were thought to be extraluminal .\nThe primary diagnosis at that time was complicated or perforated appendicitis with partial small bowel obstruction .\nA delayed CT scan was planned in order to follow contrast through the lower intestine and on this delayed CT scan , contrast was seen passing distally through the lower intestine .\nAt this time , on hospital day one with a diagnosis of perforated appendicitis and right lower quadrant phlegmon , it was felt that this course of action would be to either proceed with surgery or attempt to stabilize the patient with intravenous fluids , antibiotics , and possibly wait for six weeks for elective appendectomy .\nThe patient was started on triple antibiotics of ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl , kept NPO , and serial examinations were obtained .\nOver the first three hospital days , her white blood cell count fell to under 10,000 .\nSips of clear liquids were started and were tolerated without complication .\nPatient 's physical examination remained relatively unremarkable , however , she began to develop slight abdominal distention .\nAfter the patient was tolerating clear sips , she was given one liter of Golytely with the intention of clearing out her bowel in case surgery was needed .\nRepeat CAT scan was obtained on hospital day five .\nThis CAT scan was relatively unchanged showing matted loops of bowel in the right lower quadrant .\nThe appendix was not well visualized .\nThe repeat CT scan also showed contained fluid collections in the pelvis and these were not felt to be communicating .\nThese were also not felt to be collections which could be drained by interventional radiology .\nGiven the progression of the patient 's CAT scan and the relative nonprogression of her clinical course , the decision was made after discussion with the patient to proceed with exploratory laparotomy and likely ileocecectomy with secondary wound closure .\nPatient 's bowel was further prepared with p.o. erythromycin and neomycin base in one additional liter of Golytely .\nShe experienced extreme nausea and vomiting with the erythromycin and neomycin .\nOn December 3 , 1997 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and under general anesthesia , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy , drainage of intraabdominal abscesses , and appendectomy by Dr. Zamorryn He .\nNo ileocecectomy was performed .\nCultures were taken of the peritoneal fluid .\nThese peritoneal fluid cultures subsequently grew E. coli and coagulase negative Staphylococcus .\nThe patient 's perioperative antibiotics ( ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl ) were continued .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the Recovery Room then subsequently to the floor .\nPain service consultation was obtained for perioperative pain control and a patient controlled analgesia was begun .\nPatient 's nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day one and by postoperative day two , the patient was out of bed and ambulating .\nOn postoperative day three , the patient was started on oral sips and by postoperative day four , the patient was tolerating over a liter a day of clear liquids and had had one bowel movement .\nHer abdominal pain was dramatically decreased at this time .\nShe had no abdominal distention and no erythema around the wound .\nTwo Jackson-Pratts were placed intraoperatively .\nAt the time of this dictation on postoperative day four , the Jackson-Pratts had put out under 5 cc of discharge per day .\nThe patient is scheduled to be discharged tomorrow on December 8 , 1997 .\nHer Jackson-Pratt drains will be discontinued in the morning and the patient will be discharged on ofloxacin and Flagyl p.o. for a total antibiotic course of fourteen days which

was seen by Renal and a renal biopsy was discussed .\nRenal biopsy was done on 12/27/96 and was uncomplicated .\nThe results showed focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents and was ? _ ? immune .\nPatient was given cyclophosphamide 980 mg intravenously times one , Solu-Medrol one gram intravenously q.d. times three days , and she was started on Amphojel , nephrocaps , and calcium carbonate .\nShe was kept on a fluid restriction of 1000 cc per day for her poor urine output .\nPatient was also put on a renal diet .\nPatient had symptoms of epigastric pain , nausea , and vomiting probably secondary to her medications .\nSlowly , however , that resolved and also , she had some encouraging signs of diuresis with decrease in creatinine and some improvement of her symptoms .\nShe continued to do quite well with her creatinine lowering finally to 2.8 on 01/04/97 .\nThe patient was therefore discharged feeling relatively well with her decreased creatinine .", "DISPOSITION -18":

laparotomy with attempted repair of a perirenal aortic aneurysm which was subsequently aborted given the patient 's complex aortic anatomy and the extensive scar encountered .\nThe patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .\nPlease see operative note for more details .\nThe patient 's postoperative course was complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration and respiratory failure requiring intubation and ICU transfer .\nThe patient was noted to have a distal esophageal stricture near the site the of the prior paraesophageal hernia repair with a large esophageal dilation above that area .\nThis was thought to be the source of his multiple episodes of aspiration .\nThe patient underwent extensive treatment in both the ICU and the floor , which eventually resulted in extubation and placement of a PEG tube in order to pexy the stomach within the abdominal cavity .\nThis was achieved with good success , and the patient remained extubated on the floor for several days postoperatively .\nHowever , on the morning of 9/5/04 the patient did suffer what appeared to be another aspiration event , became hypoxic and a code was called .\nThe patient was intubated and placed on pressors after administration of the ACLS protocol .\nThe patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent multiple rounds of the ACLS protocol without resolution of his hypotension , bradycardia or hypoxia .\nAfter his aspiration event it was noted that the patient did develop ST elevation in the inferolateral leads .\nCardiology was consulted ; however , it was felt that this event was secondary to an aspiration event and therefore not a primary cardiac event .\nDecision was made not to take him to the Cath Lab , but to medically manage him only .\nMultiple attempts were made to resuscitate the patient using the ACLS protocol , which were unsuccessful in the setting of his coronary ischemia .\nAfter extensive attempts at resuscitation it was noted that we were dealing with a reversible ischemia , and at that time the team did discuss further management with his family .\nThe patient 's daughter did understand the current situation and understood that additional resuscitation attempts would be considered futile .\nDespite administration of additional medications the patient remained hypotensive and bradycardic , and eventually became asystolic at 8:20 a.m. on 9/5/04 .\nThe family was at the bedside at this time .\nThe medical examiner has been contacted and a post has been requested .\neScription document

with variant Guillain-Barre syndrome .\nIt was then determined that the patient should be started on intravenous immunoglobulin .\nHe was therefore started with a treatment course of 6 days of IV IgA after obtaining an IgA level .\nThe patient tolerated this treatment course well .\nHis cranial neuropathy was monitored carefully and was found to be stable to slightly improving in the first several days of treatment .\nHe was also treated with IV steroids .\nBy 08/20/2003 , the patient has tolerated the full treatment course and had a substantial improvement in his diplopia .\nIt was then

several admissions for this 72 year-old female with metastatic unresectable esophageal cancer who is admitted with generalized upper abdominal pain of several days duration .\nWe have been seeing her fairly frequently in clinic , trying to give her some palliative chemotherapy which did not seem to work ( platinum and 5FU ) and she has had an anemia requiring transfusions on a regular basis every few weeks with heme positive stools .\nOn the days leading up to her admission she had not had many bowel movements but forced one with laxatives the night before admission .\nThe abdominal pain was slightly better after defecation but was not really influenced much by position or eating .\nThe bowel movement was dark .\nShe had nausea .\nShe was regurgitating some of her saliva from the lesion in her esophagus that was preventing her from swallowing .\nShe had some dyspnea that was continuing in spite of transfusions .\nHer exam showed a blood pressure of 126/68 , heart rate 72 and regular , temperature 98.8 .\nHer pain level was rated a 5 out of 10 .\nShe was pale and exhausted .\nOld ecchymoses from a recent fall were resolving on her face and the laceration on her nasal bridge was also covered with scab .\nHer tongue was moist .\nHer JVP was less than 6 cm .\nHer lungs were clear .\nThere was a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base .\nHer abdomen was softly protuberant .\nThere was a few tingling bowel sounds .\nThe liver is 10 below the right costal margin at the MCL , firm and tender .\nNo hepatic rub .\nRectal ; good tone , empty vault but the material present is dark brown and guaiac positive .\nNeuro exam ; positive for generalized weakness / deconditioning , but cranial nerves and mentation were intact .", "LABORATORY DATA -8": "LABORATORY DATA  \nIncluded an abdominal film that showed nonspecific gas pattern .\nHer sodium was 130 , potassium 4.2 , her BUN was 27 , creatinine 0.8 .\nHer plasma glucose was 409 , her albumin 1.6 .\nHer alk phos 816 .\nALT 53 , AST 113 , LDH 699 , white blood count was 17.3 with 85 polys , 12 lymphs , no bands .\nHer crit was 21.6 and her platelets were 100,000 .", "HOSPITAL COURSE -9": "HOSPITAL COURSE  \nThe patient was brought into the hospital and begun on IV fluids along with some clear liquids if she could tolerate them and her condition did not really improve , although she would keep reporting that each day she was a little bit better .\nShe was really too weak to get out of bed .\nShe only picked at her food and still had some dysphagia for solids .\nBecause of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and transfusions , we suspected that the esophageal lesion itself was probably the source of this bleeding and perhaps some palliative radiation therapy would both open the sphincter area for swallowing and staunch the bleeding .\nTo that end , external beam radiation therapy was begun and she tolerated it fairly well .\nSome episodes of nausea , but only received about four or five doses of it without any marked change in how she felt .\nOver this period of time , there has been tentative plans to try to get her closer to home to the Lida Shonic,nsol Memorial Hospital home or even to her own home , to be able to died in her own bed but this was not possible because the family felt uncertain about being able to provide enough safe care for her , even for a brief period of time .\nUltimately she became jaundiced and encephalopathic and the decision was to let her stay in the hospital .\nShe had previously established that she did not want resuscitation or intubation and this was abided by and she passed away in her sleep at 6:45 am on 5/22/03 .\nThe family was not interested in having an autopsy .\nLYN MEARD RALEKOTE , M.D.", "DICTATING FOR -10": "DICTATING FOR
