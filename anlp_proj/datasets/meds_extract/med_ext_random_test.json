        "1": "rate of 14, he is sating 97 % on room air. he was obtunded and responded to the pain by localizing with his left hand. his skin was dry and cold to the touch. he had dry mucous membranes. he had no jugular venous distention. his heart had regular rate and rhythm with normal s1 and s2 heart sounds. he did have a 2 / 6 systolic ejection murmur. his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. his abdomen was soft and nondistended, positive bowel sounds. rectal exam was deferred. bilateral above the knee amputations with no signs of infection from the past surgical site. he had 2 + radial pulses. his neuro exam, he was obtunded. his pupils were equal and reactive to light. he had no thorough reflex. on initial examination, he had increased tone in his upper left extremity and he was moving his left upper extremity but not his right. laboratory data : on admission, his chem - 7 was pertinent for a glucose of 242, a creatinine of 1. 5, and a bun of 40. his white count was 11. 1 with a crit of 31. 6 and platelets of 314, 000. his pt was 13. 8 and inr of 1. 1 and a ptt of 29. 3. his ekg showed sinus bradycardia with t - wave inversions in i, avl, v3 through v6 with no st changes. compared to a prior ekg in august of 2004, there were no acute changes. his initial set of cardiac enzymes was negative. a foley catheter was placed with frank pus expressed into the foley catheter bag. a ua was sent from that specimen, which showed greater than 200 white blood cells, 3 + leuk esterase, negative nitrites, and 2 + bacteria. hospital course : id : the patient was admitted initially with the diagnosis of mental status changes and urosepsis given the grossly positive urine in the foley and a positive ua. urine culture was sent. he was started on levofloxacin for a total course of five days. he was fluid hydrated with normal saline bolus of 500 ml in a rate of 100 ml per hour after",
        "2": "that. he was also given a dose of vancomycin and ceftriaxone in the emergency department, which were discontinued on admission to the floor. the urine culture eventually did not grow out any bacteria, but did grow out greater than 100, 000 candida. he was started on fluconazole iv and that was discontinued after one day and he was switched instead to an amphotericin bladder washout with 50 mg going into a 1 l sterile water bag, which was infused into the bladder at 42 ml an hour continuously over the course of 24 hours. further into his hospital course, he again spiked the temperature on 5 / 1 / 06 to 101. 6 degrees with transient hypertension with the systolics into the 80s. at that point, he was started on vancomycin, flagyl, and gentamicin. another urine culture, blood culture and chest x - ray were done at that time. blood cultures eventually did not grow out anything as well as the urine, which was also negative. his blood pressure improved with the fluid bolus and over the next few days, he remained afebrile with a stable blood pressure. on the night before discharge, the patient ' s iv infiltrated and we were unable to replace the iv to administer a one - time dose of gentamicin of 350 mg iv, which is the extended interval dosing. at that time, we had conversation with the patient ' s healthcare proxy who is carlo serpe who agreed that no further attempts at iv should be made and we should continue to not have a foley catheter in place. on discharge, the patient will be sent home without antibiotics and without a foley catheter and the family is aware and agrees with this plan. neuro : after the initial course of antibiotics in the emergency department, we expected the patient ' s mental status to be vastly improved. on exam the next morning, he continued to be obtunded and did not seem to be moving his right arm. we therefore got a head ct, which showed a large new left mca territorial infarct. we started aspirin and we consulted neurology. neurology at first recommended that we do an mri, mra and a lumbar puncture to further investigate the mental status changes, but these studies were deferred given",
        "3": "the lack of interventions available to us given the patient ' s decreased functional status. we did however obtained a transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed an ejection fraction of 30 % and no thrombus, which could have been the nadirs for the stroke. we also got carotid ultrasounds, which did show 75 % stenosis in the right ica and 1 % to 25 % stenosis on the left, which would not explain the stroke on the left side. we also checked a lipid panel and started a low dose of simvastatin to prevent further stroke evaluation and formation. neurology had signed off and he has a neurology follow - up appointment with dr. mcleroy as an outpatient if needed. cardiovascular : he has a presumed history of coronary artery disease given his low ejection fraction and regional wall motion abnormalities seen on the echocardiogram. we started a low dose of atenolol with hold parameters as well as lisinopril and as mentioned before, we continued aspirin. endocrine : we continued the patient ' s lantus dose and titrated it as necessary. on discharge, he is going home with lantus 6 units daily with the novolog scale for additional coverage. fen : at first, we kept the patient n. p. o. given his obtunded state. we got a speech and swallow consult, which evaluated his swallowing mechanisms and agreed that he could tolerate p. o. and okayed him for nectar - thick pureed diet. he did not take a lot of p. o. during his hospital course and was only able to be fed by members of his family with any real efficacy. the topic of placing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was broached with the family, but given that the patient is taking some p. o., they wanted to defer peg tube placement given his low functional capacity and high rate of mortality over the next year. end of life : the patient came in with a code that is of dnr / dni. given the patient ' s new large left mca stroke, which has left him functionally debilitated, several end of life care discussions were held with the patient ' s healthcare proxy randolph ruddell and as well as with the patient ' s son who seemed to be his primary care give",
        "4": "##r. they have all come to the agreement that the patient would not wants to have aggressive interventions done, which include cpr, intubation, pressors, and at this point as well they feel that interventions such as iv fluids or foley catheters are not in order as well. the patient is being discharged home where the family has arranged a certain level of home healthcare with their primary physician. the patient already has a home healthcare aid who works 40 hours a week during the day and his son takes care of him the rest of the time. they are working on arrangements to further supplement his care with the home healthcare aid, which will be able to cover the nights and provide him 24 hours to provision as which he needs. several discussions were held about whether the patient should be placed in a skilled nursing facility because of his extraordinary healthcare needs and that he needs to be fed, he needs to have his diaper changed, and his hygiene looked after, but given that the patient ' s wishes were to go home, the family felt that they would try to take him home and feed him themselves and see how he does and if that did not workout well, they would opt for a more structured living facility for the patient. the patient ' s family is aware of the large amount of working effort that this patient will require in the future and they have agreed to take on this task. we have offered our social services to help with establishing further home healthcare needs, but the family has actually done this independently with the primary care physician. complications : there were no complications for this hospital stay. physical exam at discharge : on discharge, the patient was afebrile with the temperature of 98. 1, his heart rate is 68, blood pressure was 130 / 60, respirations were 20, and he is sating 94 % to 99 % on room air. on exam, he was awake and looking around. he was nonverbal. he was moving his left upper extremity but not his right using it to scratch his face and forehead. his heart was regular rate and rhythm with normal s1 and s2, no murmurs appreciated. his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. his abdomen was nondistended and soft and nontender. discharge medications : include tylenol 650 mg p. o. q. 4h. p. r. n., aspirin 325 mg p. o. daily, atenolol 25 mg p. o. daily",

        "1": "9 seconds. otherwise, he alternated sinus tachycardia and second degree heart block with runs of bradycardia at the rate of 30 - 40 and also tachycardia. hospital course : a temporary pacemaker was placed on february through the left subclavian approach. at that time, he was hemodynamically stable, except for intermittent hypertension, which was treated with nifedipine. he was transferred to the cardiology wa nas o on march, 1993 to await pacemaker placement. he was switched from nifedipine to captopril for treatment of his hypertension and his fever was treated with cefotetan for presumed aspiration pneumonia. this has resulted in a delay in his pacemaker placement. he intermittently had a pericardial friction rub on physical examination that was thought to be most likely due to myocardial irritation by the pacing wire implantation. one echocardiogram in a series did reveal a regional wall motion abnormality that may have been a function of the pacemaker wire as well. he remained afebrile and completed a course of antibiotics for his presumed aspiration pneumonia, although subsequent chest x - rays did not support that diagnosis. he required replacement of his temporary pacemaker wire while awaiting permanent pacemaker placement to decrease the risk of infection. he underwent permanent pacemaker placement in the operating room with anesthesia backup in case there was need for intubation because the patient had difficulty remaining still. the pacemaker replacement was performed on august, 1993. intubation was not necessary. disposition : he tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to home on march, 1993. medications : the medications at discharge were : kefzol 500mg q. i. d. for 3 days, and lisinopril 10mg p. o. q day. he will followup with dr. antis on january, 1993 and in tytaze th iono valley health with dr. filiberto schie secondary diagnoses were pacemaker placement and down ' s syndrome. dictated by : olin e. zeledon, m. d. hj25 attending : ulysses j. drane, m. d. ts0 so547 / 1452 batch : 2399 index no. d5gqoz62v6 d : 3 / 5 / 93 t :",
