        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM  This is a 72-year-old woman with\nstage III or stage IV breast cancer who now presents with\nparonychia and possible cellulitis of her right and left hands.\nInfectious Disease: The patient was initially started on IV\nvancomycin given the proximity of her recent chemotherapy. Her\nfinger lesions and dorsal right hand lesions began to heal within\ntwo days of her admission. She underwent incision and drainage\nof her left hand's pustular lesion with improved speed of healing\nand decreased pain. After 48 hours in the hospital the patient's\nvancomycin was switched to Keflex at which time the patient\ndeveloped a area of redness on her left forearm that measured\napproximately 6 cm x 4 cm in area. The lesion was notable for an\nerythematous base with punctuate red lesions that did not appear\nto be blanching. At the same time , she developed a very similar\nlesion on her right index finger between her MCP and PIP. The\npatient was switched back to IV vancomycin and the Infectious\nDisease consultants were called to assist with the management of\nthe patient's evolving lesions. A TTE was obtained that showed no\nvegetations and serial blood cultures showed no bacteremia. The\nInfectious Disease consultants suggested that the patient had\nparonychia in her digits with transfer of bacterial infestation\ndue to skin breakdown in the area around her nails on her hands.\nThe concern for septic emboli for which the patient was initially\ntreated became less likely in the setting of the new lesions that\nwere not in distribution that has been consistent with septic\nemboli. 48 hours later the patient was again switched from\nvancomycin to Keflex and within 12 hours developed new\nmaculopapular rash on her right neck and furuncles on her left\nand right outer labia that were exquisitely painful. The patient\nwas given one more dose of IV vancomycin and then resumed on\nKeflex. Dermatologists were consulted to help determine whether\nthe patient was suffering from shingles and they deemed that she\nwas not and that her new rash was likely eczematous in nature and\ntopical steroid creams were prescribed. The new rash on the\nright neck quickly resolved and the furuncles on her labia were\nsymptomatically managed with sitz bath three times daily in\naddition to her oral cephalosporin antibiotic.\nThroughout the course of evolving dermatologic findings that the\npatient experienced and the pain associated with them the patient\nhad continued to have absolutely no systemic complications\nassociated with these lesions. In particular , she did not have\nfever at all during the course of her hospitalization , she did\nnot have chills or sweats , she developed no new heart murmurs ,\nand her blood cultures remained negative throughout the course.\nThe patient was started on IV acyclovir when her new rash\ndeveloped and on the day of discharge was switched over to\nValtrex 1000 mg t.i.d. for management of presumed HSV infection\nthough cultures remained pending at the time of discharge. The\npatient will be discharged on Keflex and Valtrex to complete a\ncourse of ten days on each.\nEndocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetes , was\nplaced on a weight based insulin regimen with good effect during\nthe course of her hospitalization. On discharge , she will resume\nher Lantus 40 units nightly.\nCardiovascular: The patient has a history of diastolic\ndysfunction with a clean cath in 2005. Her aspirin , statin ,\nZestril , Cardizem , Lasix and nitrates were continued during the\ncourse of her hospitalization in the same way that she takes them\nat home with very well controlled blood pressures and no issues\nwith her rhythm.\nThe patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea but does not\nuse CPAP and do not have any difficulties with her oxygenation\neven while sleeping.\nHeme: The patient was initially anemic and thrombocytopenic on\nadmission. She received one unit of packed red blood cells and\nher hematocrit remained stable through the duration of her\nhospitalization.\nOncology: The patient has ductal carcinoma and inflammatory\nbreast cancer that is likely stage IV and she is status post\ncycle 2 of 16 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Adriamycin and\ncytoxan with a plan for surgical removal after her\nchemotherapy.",

At\nthe time of admission , the patient was felt to be at risk\nsecondary to his sick sinus syndrome and new left bundle-branch\nblock. He was felt to be at risk for asystole and symptomatic\nbradycardia with any blocking agents. Therefore , transvenous\npacer was scheduled to be placed in the Cath Lab.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM-13": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM \n1. Cardiovascular:\na. Rhythm: Shortly after admission , the patient had a temporary\nventricular pacer placed on 9/29/05 with a heart rate of less\nthan 50. After the procedure , the patient was admitted to the\nCCU with atrial flutter with RVR and a rate in the 20s. The rate\nwas intermittently controlled with a combination of IV digoxin\nand Lopressor. On 8/24/05 , a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker\nwas implanted with VVI at 50. Throughout the next two days , the\npatient's heart rate continued to be difficult to control , but\nimproved with diltiazem. The patient was initiated on an\namiodarone load on 1/21/05 .  The following day , he converted to\nnormal sinus rhythm spontaneously. At that time , he continued to\nbe ventricularly paced , and the pacemaker was changed to DDD on\n6/17/05 .  For the remainder of the hospitalization , the patient\nremained in normal sinus rhythm and was dual-paced without any\nrecurrence of arrhythmias. He will be continued on his\namiodarone load , which was 2.9 g upon discharge and we continued\nfor a total load of 10 g.\nb. Pump: Upon admission , an echocardiogram on 8/23/05 showed\nan EF of 20-25% with regional wall motion abnormalities noted in\nthe intraventricular septum , which was akinetic as well as global\nhyperkinesis of the left ventricle. On admission , the patient\nhad indications of heart failure , including increased JVP and\nbilateral lower extremity edema , as well as pulmonary effusions.\nThe patient was diuresed effectively with low-dose IV Lasix. His\nadmission weight was 91 kg , and upon discharge , it was\napproximately 87 kg. The patient was given intermittent Lasix 10\nmg IV for diuresis to maintain a negative I&amp;O of 500 mL. Upon\ndischarge , the patient may require continued diuresis with home\nregimen of p.o. Lasix. In addition , the patient was noted to\nhave marked hypertension throughout his stay. Blood pressure was\noccasionally difficulty to control , and at times , required IV\nnitro drip. Systolic blood pressures were noted to as high as\n180 and as low as 100 with IV nitro drip. The patient's blood\npressure was managed with calcium channel blocker , beta-blocker ,\nas well as ACE inhibitor. Upon transfer to the cardiology floor\non 6/17/05 , the p.o. diltiazem was increased. Upon discharge ,\nthe patient will be continued on a home regimen of lisinopril 10\nmg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and diltiazem\nextended release 360 mg p.o. daily. At the time of discharge ,\nthe patient's blood pressure was well controlled with systolic\nblood pressures ranging from 110 to 120s.\nc. Ischemia: Upon admission , the patient had cardiac enzyme\nelevation with initially 0.27 , which elevated to a max of 1.27 on\n6/11/05 .  Initially , the enzyme elevations were thought to be\nsecondary to demand ischemia in the setting of an elevated heart\nrate and volume overload. However , the patient underwent a\ncardiac catheterization on 3/19/05 which showed evidence of\ncoronary artery disease , two-vessel disease , specifically , there\nwas a LAD proximal 90% lesion as well as diffuse proximal-mid\nstanding 80% lesion , as well as RTLV-BR mid discrete 80% lesion\nbeyond the bifurcation of RPDA. On 3/19/05 , the patient had a\nsuccessful roto-ablation , angioplasty , and insertion of three\ncipher DES to the LAD resulting in TIMI 2 flow. On 8/0/05 , the\npatient returned to the cath lab , and at that time , he had a DES\nplacement at distal RCA. The patient denied a chest pain\nthroughout his stay. Upon discharge , he was able to ambulate\nwithout significant dyspnea on exertion or chest discomfort.\n2. Psychiatry: At the beginning of the hospital stay , the\npatient was confused and somewhat agitated. His behavior was\ncontrolled with Haldol as well as p.r.n. Ativan. The patient's\nconfusion and delirium improved significantly , and the Haldol and\nAtivan were tapered off. Prior to discharge , he was reinitiated\non his home regimen of Zyprexa. The patient has a longstanding\nhistory of dementia. Geriatrics consult followed in this case\nand advised on titration of a Haldol.\n3. Vascular: Following the cardiac catheterization , the patient\nwas noted to have a right femoral bruit. A vacular ultrasound\nwas obtained on 3/6/05 and did not show any evidence of an AV\nfistula.\n4. Heme: The patient is on chronic anticoagulation for atrial\nfibrillation. Upon admission , his INR was 2.9 and became\nelevated to a supratherapeutic level. Therefore , his Coumadin\nwas held. The patient will be reinitiated on Coumadin when his\nINR is below 2. Goal INR will be between 2 and 3.\n5. Endocrine: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and\nwas continued on his home dose of Synthroid 25 mcg p.o. daily.\nThyroid function tests were checked and were within normal\nlimits. In addition , the patient was noted to have mildly\nelevated fasting blood glucoses during his admission. His blood\nsugars ranged from 95 to 182. He was maintained on a regular\nsliding scale insulin and required only minimal units of\nsupplemental insulin. A hemoglobin A1c was ordered , and the\nresults are still pending at this time.\n6. GI: The patient was noted to have significant constipation\nthroughout his stay and was continued on an aggressive bowel\nregimen , which included Colace , senna , lactulose , and Dulcolax.\nThe patient has a history of GI bleed. He was noted to have a\nsmall amount of blood in the stools secondary to constipation ,\nbut this was resolved with additional bowel movements. His\nhematocrit remained stable , with no signs of anemia. The patient\ndoes have a history of colon cancer for which he underwent a\ncolectomy. He will be followed as an outpatient.\n7. FEN: Due to the patient's heart failure , he was placed on a\n2-liter fluid restriction as well as 2 g salt restriction. The\npatient was continued on a low-cholesterol , low-salt diet. Due\nto his mild sedation with Haldol , the patient was evaluated by\nspeech and swallow and initially placed on mechanical soft diet\nwith some honey-thick liquids. As his mental status improved\nsignificantly , the patient was returned to a house diet ,\nlow-cholesterol , low-fat , with the previous salt and fluid\nrestrictions. The patient was continued on light scale\nthroughout his stay.\n8. ID: The patient was noted to have a urinary tract infection\nbased on urinalysis upon admission. His culture remained\nnegative throughout his stay. He was initially given\nceftriaxone. Initially , he was started on Keflex following on\npacemaker placement for antibiotic coverage , which was\ndiscontinued on 8/24/05 .  The patient remained afebrile , with no\nsigns of systemic infection throughout his stay.\n9. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on a PPI. His INR\nremained subtherapeutic throughout his stay.",

It was thought that his mental status\nchanges were likely secondary to dehydration and were resolved at\nthe time of discharge.\n2. Pulmonary - During resuscitation of the patient's dehydration ,\nhe developed an O2 requirement although chest x-ray did not show\nany evidence for fluid overload or infiltrates. Occasional wheezes\nwere appreciated on examination and the patient's symptoms improved\nsignificantly with occasional nebulizer treatments of Albuterol and\nAtrovent. At the time of discharge , the patient was oxygenating\nwell.\n3. Cardiovascular - There were no acute cardiac issues during this\nhospitalization. Patient's losartan was held at admission given\nhis acute renal failure but other outpatient medications were\ncontinued.\n4. Hematology - The patient had a history of MDS and was a patient\nof Dr. Boivin . At the time of admission , the patient's hematocrit\ndropped 10 points but was thought to be likely due to hydration.\nSince that time , the patient's hematocrit has remained stable at\n35.\n5. Infectious disease - At the time of admission , the patient's\nblood cultures , urine cultures , and stool cultures were all\nnegative. Chest x-ray on March , 2003 was clear. It was felt\nthat the most likely etiology of his acute worsening of his\ndiarrhea was viral gastroenteritis. He also did receive a 7-day\ncourse of levofloxacin and Flagyl for empiric abdominal coverage.\nThe patient remained afebrile since the time of his antibiotics.\n6. Gastrointestinal - The patient is status post right\nhemicolectomy. He has a long history of diarrhea and presented to\nthis admission with explosive diarrhea and guaiac positive brown\nstool. At the time of admission , Kaopectate and Lomotil were\nstarted. On August , 2003 , he was noted to have increased\ndistention but a KUB was negative at that time for partial\nobstruction or impaction. There were concerns that the patient's\nabdominal symptoms might be secondary to ischemia so an MRI was\nobtained which showed proximal disease in the SMA , IMA , and celiac\nbut overall with good distal flow. An abdominal CT was obtained\nwhich showed a thick small bowel and dilated gallbladder with\nstranding but no evidence for ischemia. Gastrointestinal\nconsultation was obtained and on June , 2003 , and\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which revealed grade IV\ngastritis. As a result , the patient was started on Nexium 40\nb.i.d.\n7. Renal - The patient has a history of chronic renal\ninsufficiency. The entire hospitalization , his BUN was in the\nfifties with a creatinine of 2.2. His FENA was less than 0.1% and\nthe patient was thought to be extremely intervascularly dry. With\ngentle hydration , the patient's creatinine eventually improved to\n1.9 at the time of this dictation.",

        "ID-13": "ID  The patient was admitted initially with the diagnosis of\nmental status changes and urosepsis given the grossly positive\nurine in the Foley and a positive UA. Urine culture was sent.\nHe was started on levofloxacin for a total course of five days.\nHe was fluid hydrated with normal saline bolus of 500 mL in a\nrate of 100 mL per hour after that. He was also given a dose of\nvancomycin and ceftriaxone in the emergency department , which\nwere discontinued on admission to the floor. The urine culture\neventually did not grow out any bacteria , but did grow out\ngreater than 100 , 000 candida. He was started on fluconazole IV\nand that was discontinued after one day and he was switched\ninstead to an amphotericin bladder washout with 50 mg going into\na 1 L sterile water bag , which was infused into the bladder at 42\nmL an hour continuously over the course of 24 hours. Further\ninto his hospital course , he again spiked the temperature on\n5/1/06 to 101.6 degrees with transient hypertension with the\nsystolics into the 80s. At that point , he was started on\nvancomycin , Flagyl , and gentamicin. Another urine culture , blood\nculture and chest x-ray were done at that time. Blood cultures\neventually did not grow out anything as well as the urine , which\nwas also negative. His blood pressure improved with the fluid\nbolus and over the next few days , he remained afebrile with a\nstable blood pressure. On the night before discharge , the\npatient's IV infiltrated and we were unable to replace the IV to\nadminister a one-time dose of gentamicin of 350 mg IV , which is\nthe extended interval dosing. At that time , we had conversation\nwith the patient's healthcare proxy who is Carlo Serpe who\nagreed that no further attempts at IV should be made and we\nshould continue to not have a Foley catheter in place. On\ndischarge , the patient will be sent home without antibiotics and\nwithout a Foley catheter and the family is aware and agrees with\nthis plan.\nNeuro: After the initial course of antibiotics in the emergency\ndepartment , we expected the patient's mental status to be vastly\nimproved. On exam the next morning , he continued to be obtunded\nand did not seem to be moving his right arm. We therefore got a\nhead CT , which showed a large new left MCA territorial infarct.\nWe started aspirin and we consulted neurology. Neurology at\nfirst recommended that we do an MRI , MRA and a lumbar puncture to\nfurther investigate the mental status changes , but these studies\nwere deferred given the lack of interventions available to us\ngiven the patient's decreased functional status. We did however\nobtained a transthoracic echocardiogram , which showed an ejection\nfraction of 30% and no thrombus , which could have been the nadirs\nfor the stroke. We also got carotid ultrasounds , which did show\n75% stenosis in the right ICA and 1% to 25% stenosis on the left ,\nwhich would not explain the stroke on the left side. We also\nchecked a lipid panel and started a low dose of simvastatin to\nprevent further stroke evaluation and formation. Neurology had\nsigned off and he has a neurology follow-up appointment with Dr.\nMcleroy as an outpatient if needed.\nCardiovascular: He has a presumed history of coronary artery\ndisease given his low ejection fraction and regional wall motion\nabnormalities seen on the echocardiogram. We started a low dose\nof atenolol with hold parameters as well as lisinopril and as\nmentioned before , we continued aspirin.\nEndocrine: We continued the patient's Lantus dose and titrated\nit as necessary. On discharge , he is going home with Lantus 6\nunits daily with the NovoLog scale for additional coverage.",
        "FEN-14": "FEN  At first , we kept the patient n.p.o. given his obtunded\nstate. We got a speech and swallow consult , which evaluated his\nswallowing mechanisms and agreed that he could tolerate p.o. and\nokayed him for nectar-thick pureed diet. He did not take a lot\nof p.o. during his hospital course and was only able to be fed by\nmembers of his family with any real efficacy. The topic of\nplacing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was broached\nwith the family , but given that the patient is taking some p.o. ,\nthey wanted to defer PEG tube placement given his low functional\ncapacity and high rate of mortality over the next year.",
        "END OF LIFE-15": "END OF LIFE  The patient came in with a code that is of DNR/DNI.\nGiven the patient's new large left MCA stroke , which has left him\nfunctionally debilitated , several end of life care discussions\nwere held with the patient's healthcare proxy Randolph Ruddell and\nas well as with the patient's son who seemed to be his primary\ncare giver. They have all come to the agreement that the patient\nwould not wants to have aggressive interventions done , which\ninclude CPR , intubation , pressors , and at this point as well they\nfeel that interventions such as IV fluids or Foley catheters are\nnot in order as well. The patient is being discharged home where\nthe family has arranged a certain level of home healthcare with\ntheir primary physician. The patient already has a home\nhealthcare aid who works 40 hours a week during the day and his\nson takes care of him the rest of the time. They are working on\narrangements to further supplement his care with the home\nhealthcare aid , which will be able to cover the nights and\nprovide him 24 hours to provision as which he needs. Several\ndiscussions were held about whether the patient should be placed\nin a skilled nursing facility because of his extraordinary\nhealthcare needs and that he needs to be fed , he needs to have\nhis diaper changed , and his hygiene looked after , but given that\nthe patient's wishes were to go home , the family felt\nthat they would try to take him home and feed him themselves and\nsee how he does and if that did not workout well , they would opt\nfor a more structured living facility for the patient. The\npatient's family is aware of the large amount of working effort\nthat this patient will require in the future and they have agreed\nto take on this task. We have offered our social services to\nhelp with establishing further home healthcare needs , but the\nfamily has actually done this independently with the primary care\nphysician.",

CP only\nceased after nitro was administered in the ER 30 minutes later. At LC ,\npt ruled out for MI by enzymes , with\nno EKG ischemic changes , and was treated with Lovenox. At GMH , pt had\nan episode of asymptomatic atrial\ntachycardia , resolving spontaneously. On 8/4/02 ,\npt was transferred to MHC for cardiac cath and potential\nstent/brachytherapy if necessary.\nHospital\ncourse:\nCV - Pt underwent cath 5/3/02. Both stents\nfrom 1/7 were found to be stenosed ( LACX 85% and diagonal 95% ).\nLAD had 50% stenosis. Stents were tx w/ angioplasty and brachytherapy.\nPt placed on integrilin IV for 14 hours. Pt ruled out per routine for\nMI by CK after procedure. He had no episodes of chest pain after his\nadmission to GUH .\n- Pt has had multiple episodes of\nasymptomatic\nafib , aflutter , and atrial tachycardia , with RVR into the 150's , with\nrate responding\nwell to 5mg IV lopressor. On 2/0/02 , lopressor increased to\n75mg po tid in hopes of achieving rhythm/rate\ncontrol , unsucessfully. EP was consulted as to a possible ablation\nprocedure , but felt that medical management , if possible , would be a\nbetter solution , given that multifocal atrial tachycardias and afib\nwould not necessary be resolved with an ablation procedure. The\npatient also preferred medical management. On 11/9/02 , verapamil\n40mg po tid was added to the regimen , with patient still having\nepisodes of rapid heart rate. Verapamil was increased to 80mg po\ntid with resulting rate control. However , patient had two episodes\nof asymptomatic low BP ( 90/50 ). On 5/17/02 , verapamil was decreased\nto 60mg po tid , with both HR and BP control. Abnormal rhythms\ncontinued , without RVR.\n- Given afib/aflutter rhythms , patient was placed on coumadin 5mg po qd\non 11/9/02 ( prior to his procedure , he was maintained on heparin drip ,\nand immediately post-procedure , he was maintained on integrilin drip ).\n- Pt placed on statin at ACH ; maintained on statin at AMC . Patient\nmaintained on asa.\n- New d/c medications: Given difficulty of maintaining patient's heart\nrate and blood pressure , pt was d/c'ed on verapamil and lopressor ,\nboth tid drugs. At f/u appt with cardiologist or PCP , this regimen\ncan be altered as appropriate. Pt also d/c'd on coumadin , plavix\n( for 6months ) , and simvastatin.\nPulm - Severe COPD , treated with home O2.\nBaseline O2 92% on 2L , and SOB with minor exertion.

Pulmonary: The patient was kept on prednisone 60 mg p.o.\ndaily for the first several days of his floor admission and he\nwas continued on DuoNeb q.6 h. , albuterol labs were added q.6 h.\nstaggered with DuoNeb such that he was receiving nebulizer\ntreatments every three hours. He was continued on chest PT. The\npatient was started on CPAP overnight for history of obstructive\nsleep apnea. He had not been compliant with CPAP as an\noutpatient. Advair was continued. The patient did well with\nthis regimen and his oxygen requirements were titrated from 5\nliters to 2.5 liters at the time of discharge. At this level of\noxygen he was satting in the low to mid 90s with ambulatory sat\nof approximately 90%. The importance of continuing use of home\noxygen both during the day and at night was discussed at length\nwith the patient , though he continued to complain that he had\ndifficulty going about his daily activities wearing his oxygen. Prednisone\nwas slowly tapered and at the time of discharge the patient was\ntaking 40 mg of prednisone per day. He will take 20 mg starting\nthe first day after his discharge and will complete a slow\napproximately 2-week taper. His home dose of Lasix was\ncontinued. The patient was not felt to be clinically volume\noverloaded. However , he auto-diuresed 1-2 liters the majority\nof the days he was admitted to the floor. Followup was arranged\nwith the patient's primary care provider and his pulmonologist\nDr. Gering . The possibility of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation\nwas discussed at length with the patient and his wife who were\nextremely resistant to any other inpatient care. He is therefore\ndischarged with home VNA , though the possibility of inpatient vs outpatient\npulmonary rehabilitation should be considered at his followup.\n2. Renal: The patient's creatinine trended down throughout his\ntime on the floor. This happened in the setting of continued\nauto-diuresis , suggesting that his initial renal failure was due\nto a low flow state as result of heart failure rather than\nhypovolemia. At the time of discharge his creatinine was 1.3.\nHe was followed by the Renal Team during his admission. His ARB\nwas initially held but then restarted upon improvement of his\ncreatinine. Per renal , his elevated BUN in the range of 200 was\nfelt to be secondary to steroid use. This had normalized by the\ntime of discharge. The patient was worked up for a possible AV\nfistula or graft placement in the left upper extremity in the\nnear future. He will follow up with vascular surgery as an\noutpatient for vein mapping as an outpatient. He should not receive blood\ndraws in the left upper extremity of avoidable.\n3. Infectious disease: The patient was continued on vancomycin\nand Levaquin for a seven-day course. He completed this course\nduring this hospitalization and he discharged off antibiotics.\nAll cultures were no growth at the time of discharge.\n4. Cardiovascular: He was continued on aspirin and\nanti-lipidemics. His Lopressor was titrated for hypertension and\nhe is discharged on 300 mg of Toprol per day the rest of his\nantihypertensive medicines have not changed. He was kept on tele\nduring his admission and did have occasional episodes of NSVT\nusually triplets or couplets. These were asymptomatic.\n5. Endocrine: Mr. Vitro insulin requirements increased\ndramatically during his ICU admission , likely as a result of\nsteroid use and stress. His insulin requirements fell to their\npreadmission levels during his admission on the floor.\n6. Prophylaxis: He was maintained on heparin and proton pump\ninhibitor.",

Her epistaxis now\nhas resolved and now with a stable hematocrit of greater than 30 ,\nstatus post 7 units packed red blood cells. ENT was consulted\nfor epistaxis.\n2. Fluid collection in the abdomen. The patient had IR guided\ndrainage of fluid collection done on 1/16 continued to drain\ngreater than 700 mL per day. She had a repeat CAT scan on\n6/14/06 , which indicated large amount of ascites in the abdomen\nand pelvis. Fluid pockets where IR drain was placed were no\nlonger present. IR drain was planned to be removed by CIS.\n3. Melena. Upper endoscopy was consisted with evidence of small\nshallow pyloric ulcers. No evidence of bleeding source. The\npatient was advanced to a full diet and was placed on a proton\npump inhibitor and H. pylori were found.\n4. CVS.\na. Elevated troponin , history of hypertension , no known coronary\nartery disease , no chest pain , but does have dyspnea on exertion\nlikely secondary to severe anemia , demand ischemia ,\nST-depressions on EKG since with the demand ischemia. This\npatient's serial troponins had been trending downward with\naggressive rate control. She had a second episode of atrial\nfibrillation over the weekend of 10/8/06. The patient had an\nepisode which was converted with amiodarone. The patient had\nelevated troponins that as stated above were turning down and\nsome ST-depressions on EKG , which was most likely secondary to\ndemand ischemia. The patient had an echocardiogram while\ninhouse , which showed normal left ventricular function. No\nregional wall motion abnormalities.\nb. AVR , MVR. Heparin was stopped for therapeutic INR on\nCoumadin.\nc. Endocarditis. TEE. The patient had a transesophageal\nechocardiogram which was consistent with small vegetation on the\naortic valve. She was placed on IV vancomycin , rifabutin , and\nLinezolid. She had positive cultures on 5/11/06 and then again\non 11/10/06 both blood cultures from PICC line grew gram-negative\ncocci in clusters. PICC line was removed. She had ongoing\nbacteremia. She had a repeat TEE on 8/6/06 , they indicated no\nvegetation seen on the aortic valve; however , she continued to be\nbacteremic. She was then continued on vancomycin and daptomycin\nper ID. Linezolid was discontinued on 0/16/06 per ID. She\nmaintained negative blood cultures since 5/22/06.\nd. Atrial fibrillation. The patient is in atrial fibrillation\nwith rates of 130s on 1/30/06 , was given diltiazem 10 mg x2 then\nstarted on IV amiodarone. She converted to sinus rhythm with\namiodarone , finished IV load , and continued on 200 mg daily. It\nwas planned for her to taper from there.\n5. Renal. Status post renal transplant on FK , CellCept , and\nprednisone. The patient had a renal ultrasound , which was\nnegative for hydronephrosis , obstruction or infarct. She had a\nrenal transplant biopsy on 3/13/06 , which results indicative\nmild tubular damage and capillaritis suggestive of humeral\nrejection. She received IVIG x2 , pulse steroids. She progressed\nto have an increase in her creatinine to 5.7 and decreased urine\noutput. The patient was initiated on dialysis on 2/5/06 , again\non 7/23/06 , 9/27/06 , and 11/16/06. She then was maintained on\nMonday , Wednesday , and Friday schedule for dialysis and was\nplaced on Renagel for increased phosphate.\n6. GI. The patient throughout her hospital course had\nincreasing abdominal fluid collection with increasing shortness\nof breath. She had an abdominal ultrasound to assess her amount\nof fluids and marked for paracentesis. CIS marked the patient\nfor paracentesis. Paracentesis was attempted at the bedside with\nonly 700 mL of bloody gastric ascites. The patient had minimal\nimprovement of discomfort. The fluid was sent for gram stain ,\nLDH , albumin , white blood cell count , and differential. CT of\nthe abdomen was consistent with moderate amount of ascites on the\nright side of the abdomen mildly distended small bowel , question\nof an ileus , which began to improve as of 6/24/06.\n7. Neurologically , the patient had a new onset of psychiatric\nmanic disorder versus organic dementia.

Pulmonary. The patient continued to spike fevers about 103\non 0/20/06. Chest x-ray had showed left lower lobe pneumonia.\nID was consulted. The patient was given ceftazidime 2 g IV x1.\nOn 7/9/06 , the patient was transferred out of the MICU. She\nwas hypotensive; however , her CVP line showed a blood pressure of\n15-20 points higher systolic then what were showing on her\nperipheral blood pressure cuff. She had nosocomial pneumonia ,\nwhich had improved. Her ceftazidime was stopped and aztreonam\nwas stopped. Her ileus seemed to be improving. She had a bowel\nmovement. She also developed hyperbilirubinemia and therefore\namiodarone was stopped. Her NG tube was removed. Her abdomen\nremained tight from fluid overload. Her dialysis alternating\nwith ultrafiltration. Fluid form her abdomen grew E. coli , on\nvancomycin. She was on Nexium orally. Her feeding tube was\nplaced secondary to malnutrition and third spacing. She was\nstarted on Mepron 10 mL per hour , meropenem was started on\n3/10/06 for a question of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\nPlan was for paracentesis on 9/23/06. Renally , the patient\nremained anuric and dialysis dependent. FK was continued and\nCellCept was discontinued on 5/3/06. The patient continued to\nhave thrombocytopenia , neutropenia , and anemia. In the early\nmorning of 5/1/06 , the patient began having large volume emesis\nwith aspiration. She was transferred to the medical intensive\ncare unit and resulted in respiratory arrest , pulses , electrical\nactivity arrest. A code was initiated with intubation. The\npatient decompensated and became very hypotensive. Despite the\nefforts of CPR , the patient became profoundly bradycardiac and\nadvanced to PA again , not responding. After 1.5 hour FR code ,\nefforts were discontinued. The patient was pronounced at 8\no'clock a.m. deceased.\neScription document: 9-7263011 CSSten Tel\nDictated By: FUNDIS , DUSTY\nAttending: TEPLEY , SHERWOOD\nDictation ID 5552099",

The patient tolerated the\nprocedure well but immediately postoperatively the patient was\nnoted to have non-Dopplerable signals in his left foot. The\npatient was brought back to the operating room at which time the\nsignificant sized clot was found in the distal anastomosis of the\ngraft which was removed. Again , the patient was returned to the\nrecovery room and , in the ensuing hours , the patient again lost all\nDopplerable signals in his left foot. On postoperative day #1 the\npatient returned one more time to the operating room for revision\nof his left bypass graft. The patient tolerated the procedure well\nand had strong Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior\ntibial pulse throughout the remainder of his hospital stay. The\npatient was kept on perioperative Ancef antibiotics.\nOn postoperative day #0 the patient was found to be in respiratory\ndistress. Chest x-ray revealed flash pulmonary edema. Cardiology\nconsult was obtained at that time and an echocardiogram revealed an\nejection fraction of 35 percent with moderate aortic stenosis and\nregurgitation. The patient ruled in by enzymes for a myocardial\ninfarction. The patient was kept on beta blocker for goal heart\nrate less than 75 and was started on Digoxin. Cardiology also\nrecommended the addition of an Ace inhibitor for further blood\npressure control. The patient remained stable. He remained in the\nSurgical Intensive Care Unit for the first three days\npostoperatively at which time the patient was medically stable and\ntransferred to a surgical floor and monitored bed. Repeat\nechocardiogram on postoperative day #4 and #3 was unchanged from\nhis prior echocardiogram , again , revealing an ejection fraction of\n35 percent with global hypokinesis , severe aortic stenosis , and\nmoderate aortic regurgitation. Cardiology continued to follow the\npatient throughout his hospital stay. They recommended the patient\nreturn for cardiac catheterization following a short stay in acute\nrehabilitation. Otherwise the patient progressed well. He did\ndevelop a small amount of erythema in his left lower extremity\nincision site. He was restarted on antibiotics and the erythema\nslowly regressed over the ensuing three days. Otherwise the\npatient's incisions to his right arm , left leg , and right leg all\nwere clean , dry , and intact with staples.\nPhysical therapy consult was obtained and the patient was able to\nambulate with the assistance of a walker. The patient continued to\nprogress well. He tolerated a regular diet and ambulated and\nvoided without difficulty.

The\npatient had done well at rehab with significant improvement in\nhis pulmonary status to the point that he was off the ventilator\nusing a nasal cannula for supplementary oxygen only. He also had\nsignificant improvement in his functional status with ability to\nstand and ambulate for short distances as well as improvement in\nhis mental status back to baseline. However , over the several\ndays prior to this admission his respiratory status had been\ndeteriorating with an increasing respiratory rate , increased work\nof breathing , and falling oxygen saturations. For the last two\nnights prior to admission , the patient had to be bagged overnight\nand was not able to maintain saturations above the high 80s. He\nhad been afebrile with no change in cough or secretions. He\ndenied any abdominal pain , vomiting , or diarrhea. He was started\non empiric levofloxacin on the day prior to admission as well as\nsome increased diuresis with an increase in his standing Lasix\ndose to 40 mg IV q. 8h. According to the patient's wife , this\ndid improve his respiratory status somewhat; however , he was\nstill unable to remain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient\nalso received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit\nof 25 the day prior to admission. The morning of admission to\nRonon Health it was felt that the patient's\nrespiratory distress and poor oxygenation were such that he\nneeded to return to ventilator assistance. The patient was then\ntransferred to the Prinin Health Emergency\nDepartment where on arrival his vitals were notable for a heart\nrate of 76 , blood pressure 123/62 , respirations 28 , oxygen\nsaturation of 92% by nasal cannula. He was placed on the\nventilator at pressure support with 10 of pressure support and 5\nof peak with an FIO2 of 50%. Arterial blood gas at this time was\n7.38 , 66 , and 63.",

Hypoxemic respiratory failure , likely multifactorial from\nobesity-hypoventilation syndrome , sleep apnea , question COPD.\nRecurrent decompensation was thought to be precipitated by volume\noverload and subsequent pleural effusion. The patient improved\ndramatically with aggressive diuresis and he was able to\nsuccessfully transition back to use of trache collar during the\nday , however , it seems that he does better with ventilatory\nsupport overnight and current permanent plan of care is to\ntransition patient to home ventilator support such that he will\nsupplemental oxygen either by nasal cannula or trache collar\nduring the day and be able to use the ventilator at night. The\npatient was also continued on inhaled steroids and nebulizers.\n2. Positive blood culture , 1/4 bottles from blood cultures drawn\non 9/28/06 were positive for Gram-positive cocci and clusters;\nhowever , he was afebrile and with no clinical evidence of\ninfection , so this was thought likely to be contaminant and no\ntreatment was given.\n3. Fluid overload. As noted , the patient responded very well to\ndiuresis. He was transitioned to a new stable dose of p.o. Lasix\nnamely 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. This will need to be adjusted as\nneeded.\n4. Hypertension. The patient was continued on his home regimen\nof labetalol and amlodipine on which he did well.\n5. Diabetes. The patient was continued on home regimen of\nLantus , however , this was titrated up somewhat due to some\nelevated sugars the last few days of his admission. He is sent\nout on Lantus 60 mg subcutaneously at bedtime as well as a\nregular insulin sliding scale.\n6. Nutrition. The patient should follow a cardiac , diabetic\nsalt restricted and fluid restricted p.o. diet. He does have a\nPEG tube for supplemental feeding should he be unable to take\np.o. but at the time of discharge he is doing well with a\nmechanical soft diet with the above restrictions.\n7. The patient is therapeutically anticoagulated on Coumadin.\nIndication is history of DVT. He will be continued on a dose of\n3 mg at bedtime.

She\nsubsequently underwent DES to ramus and LAD. Flow through the LAD was\nonly TIMI 2 by the end of the procedure. Course was complicated by\npost-MI pericarditis , apical wall thinning , and mural LV thrombus.\nShe was discharged initially to short-term rehab , then subsequently went\nhome w/ weekly f/u w/ cardiac rehab. While at short term rehab , she was\ntreated w/ doses of lasix as high as 120 mg IV. Following discharge from\nrehab , she was ultimately taken off of diuresis b/c of \"dizzy spells\" she\nwas experiencing while on lasix.\nShe did well off lasix until 2 weeks ago , when she was noted to have\ndecreased exercise tolerance and increasing fatigue at cardiac rehab.\nShe says that she is usually able to ambulate for 15 minutes on the\ntreadmill; she hasn't been able to do this for the past 2 weeks b/c of\ndyspnea and fatigue. This has been accompanied by new-onset PND\n( occurring as frequently as 3-5 times/night ) , 5 pound weight gain , and\nincreasing abdominal girth. She does acknowledge dietary indiscretion\nthis past week ( had a can of mushroom soup 4 days ago ). No orthopnea.\nMrs. Bloxsom cardiac rehab. contacted Dr. Takach ( her primary\ncardiologist ) a few days ago to inform her about Mrs. Losey DOE and\nincreasing fatigue. Starting 2 days ago , she was placed on lasix 40 mg.\nSince then , she has taken a total of 5 doses. She came to urgent care\nthis PM and was noted to desat. to 85% w/ ambulation in the setting of\nfluid overload. She was subsequently admitted.",

Since then ,\nhe claims that he has done very well with rare angina\n( approximately two times a year ) which responds well to sublingual\nnitroglycerin.\nHe underwent an exercise treadmill test in 1997 , that showed\ninferolateral ST depressions with exercise , that were considered\nnon-diagnostic , secondary to LVH and some resting EKG\nabnormalities.\nOn November , the patient noted 10 out of 10 chest pain while walking\nwith his family. He took sublingual nitroglycerin times three with\nno relief. He was taken to Tioncollgos Memorial Hospital where an EKG\nshowed ST depressions in leads V2 through V4 , and T wave flattening\nin V1 and V5. He also had T wave inversions in V2 through V4. The\npatient was treated with intravenous heparin , intravenous\nnitroglycerin , and beta blockers. He remained pain free after this\ntreatment. He eventually developed a Q wave in V1. During his\nhospitalization at Frontnor Valley Medical Center , the patient was noted to have\nan 11 beat run of V-tach on November , and was started on a lidocaine\ndrip. The lidocaine drip was stopped on July , and the\nintravenous nitroglycerin was weaned. He was placed on nitro paste\non July , and his intravenous heparin was then stopped on March .\nThe patient was transferred to Hard Hospital on March\nbecause he preferred to receive his care from his primary\ncardiologist.

This failed secondary to\nintravenous access clotting and the patient's frustration with\nhaving to lying still. The patient was subsequently converted to\noral torsemide and metolazone , torsemide 200 b.i.d. , metolazone 5\nb.i.d. , and spironolactone 25 b.i.d. as an oral regimen. Per the\npatient's request and reaching a somewhat adequate goal with this\nhospitalization , the patient requested to be discharged. He\nreported that he would follow up with the CHF nursing staff and\nwith Dr. Adamski and although we repeatedly stressed the importance\nof free water restriction and fluid restriction , he continued to\nbe noncompliant with this while inhouse. At the time the patient\nwas discharged , it was felt that he was not optimal\nhemodynamically , but had excellent followup plans and stated that\nhe would return if his condition worsened.",

        "SERVICE-2": "SERVICE \nCardiac Surgery Service.\nFor the beginning of this dictation , I am going to defer to a\npervious discharge summary dictation dictated by Dr. Antony D Tirino . Confirmation number is 196925. It was dictated on\n0/27/05 , therefore this dictation will continue over the\nhospital course starting on 10/13/05 , at which time , the patient\nwas transferred to the Step-Down Unit. We began weaning the\nmilrinone drip as well as titrating up on her diltiazem and\nNeoral. The patient was seen by Speech and Swallow and her diet\nwas liberalized to thin liquids. She was restarted on her\ndiuresis. The patient began having positive blood cultures on\n10/0/05 .  One out of two bottles from 2/28/05 grew out\nGram-positive cocci , but the patient remained afebrile and her\nwhite blood cell count was trending down. Further blood cultures\nwere sent off. Central line was discontinued on 11/29/05 and tip\nwas sent for culture. Further blood cultures were negative but\nthe line tip grew out coag-negative Staph. Echocardiogram\nresults revealed an ejection fraction of 55% , mild mitral\nregurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation and\nmoderate pericardial effusion , without evidence of hemodynamic\ncompromise. The patient underwent a cardiac biopsy on 6/14/05 ,\nwhich showed focal healing ischemic injury. Despite all negative\ncultures , the patient continued on vancomycin , Bactrim ,\nlevofloxacin and Valcyte. Speech and Swallow then started\nregular solids and thin liquid. Her medications continued to be\nmonitored by the Congestive Heart Failure Service. She did\nbecome slightly hypertensive and they increased her diltiazem.\nShe continued on her antibiotics. There is a PICC line attempted\nto be placed on 8/6/05 , however , they were unable to withdraw.\nTherefore , they would return in the morning to attempt it again.\nUpper extremity and LENIs were done , which was negative for clot ,\nexcept for in the left cephalic. Congestive heart failure people\nthen suggested that maybe it would be best that the patient just\nstayed in the hospital without getting a PICC line to complete\nher course of antibiotics. She also was going to need a repeat\nright heart catheterization and biopsy. Her antibiotic course\nwas finished on 9/20/05 .  Only other issue was that the patient\nwas seen by Ophthalmology and it was recommended that she will\nneed reading glasses when she is at home. Diabetes management\ncontinued to follow the patient and congestive heart failure did\nas well. She underwent a right heart catheterization as well as\nbiopsy on 4/23/05 , which demonstrated normal left and right\nfilling pressures. They were 6 and 14. The patient was found\nsuitable for discharge to home on 4/23/05 .  At the time of\ndischarge , Ms. Hawker looked great. Her temperature was 96 ,\nheart rate was 96 sinus , blood pressure was 110/80.

The extremities revealed open\namputations of the bilateral feet with 2+ femoral pulses and\npalpable DP and PT pulses bilaterally with right greater than left.\nThere was no evidence of cellulitis with a necrotic left fourth\ntoe.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. Vascular: The patient was admitted for the left fourth toe\namputation , which occurred on May . This wound\nwas left open. She tolerated the procedure well with a VAC change\noccurring on November at the bedside. At that time , it was noted\nthat , although , there was pink granulation tissue , the fifth toe\nhad become ischemic and nonviable. Therefore , the patient was\ntaken to the operating room on November for a left fifth toe\namputation , which was also left open. That was tolerated well , but\ndid not seem to be viable secondary to ischemia and infection.\nTherefore , on January , 2002 , she was taken to the operating room\nfor a left transmetatarsal amputation of the third , fourth and\nfifth toes. Dressing changes , wet-to-dry , were done. During that\ntime , it was noted that additional necrotic debris at the lateral\naspect of the foot required more debridement , so she was taken to\nsurgery on May for debridement and a partial resection of\nthe left fifth metatarsal. A VAC was placed and changed on\nJanuary at the bedside. On March , 2002 , the wound was\nfelt to be clean enough and a split thickness skin graft was placed\non the left foot , 75 square cm , and the donor site was the left\nthigh. This seemed to be taking well. We continued with dressing\nchanges and a heat lamp to the donor site , which healed well. On\nFebruary , 2002 , we took her to the operating room again for\ndebridement of the left foot. The plantar aspect of the skin graft\nhad become discolored and we felt the infection required\ndebridement. Intraoperatively , the bone did not seem to be\ninvolved and , at this point , we had been continuing wet-to-dry\ndressing changes and , as of March , 2002 , the plan was to take\nthe patient to the operating room on March , 2002 for another\nskin graft. Now that the wound is clean , she has completed\nantibiotics.\n2. Neurological: The patient has a history of a seizure disorder ,\nwhich has been stable on Gabitril. She is\nstatus post stroke and is stable. For her depression , she receives\nProzac. Her pain is well controlled on a Fentanyl patch with\noxycodone for p.r.n. pain and Dilaudid for breakthrough pain. The\npatient also has occasional dizziness and this is treated with\np.r.n. meclizine.\n3. Cardiovascular: The patient has coronary artery disease and is\nstatus post a myocardial infarction , and\nhypertension , which is currently well controlled on Lopressor 50 mg\nt.i.d.\n4. Respiratory: The patient has asthma that has been stable and\nnot evidenced in the hospital.\n5. GI: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux\ndisease , which is treated with esomeprazole. She is on a\ndiabetic diet. She receives Colace , Senna , multivitamins , folic\nacid and Niferex.\n6. GU: The patient is receiving Lasix 100 mg b.i.d. at this\nmoment. Her admission creatinine was 0.7 , peaked at 2.0\non February , at which time we called a renal consultation , who\nsaid she was probably pre-renal acute renal failure secondary to\nace inhibitor , Lasix and a new bunch of antibiotics. At that time\nwe held the ace inhibitor , held the Lasix , and renally dosed the\nantibiotics , at which time her creatinine came down to 1.1 , which\nis closer to her baseline. We have slowly restarted Lasix and she\nhas tolerated that. We have since discontinued her antibiotics.\n7. Heme: The patient's admission hematocrit was 25.7 , for which\nshe received 1 unit of packed red blood cells on\nMay . She received another unit of packed red blood cells on\nJune and her most recent hematocrit , on March , was 26.8.\nTherefore , she is baseline anemic.\n8. Infectious Disease: This has been another major issue for this\npatient. Starting from the beginning , on\nMarch , the patient had a urinary tract infection with mixed\nflora , for which she was treated with a five day course of Diflucan\nfor Candida. On May , a wound culture of the left foot\nshowed Pseudomonas , which was resistant to multiple drugs ,\nmultidrug resistant E. coli , and methicillin resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus , as well as multidrug resistant Klebsiella.\nOn February , when we went to the operating room for further\ndebridement of the left foot , we obtained deep cultures from the\noperating room and found Pseudomonas diphtheroid and Klebsiella ,\nwhich were sensitive to vancomycin and cefotaxime. Infectious\nDisease had consulted on our patient and recommended vancomycin ,\ncefepime and Flagyl and a two week course of these antibiotics for\na soft tissue infection. It did not appear in the operating room\nagain that the bone was involved in the infection. An MRI on\nNovember , however , showed soft tissue swelling in the sinus\ntract that was suspicious for osteomyelitis of the fifth\nmetatarsal , but , in consultation with Infectious Disease , Vascular\nSurgery , her operative findings , and clinical picture , we decided\nit looked more like a soft tissue infection and treated her for two\nweeks with antibiotics.\n9. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus and her blood\nsugar control has been an issue throughout her\nhospital stay , slowly titrating up to her current Lantus dose of\n150 units subq q.h.s. She seems to be doing well with that.\n10. Ophthalmology: The patient is status post bilateral cataract\nsurgery and attempted filter for glaucoma in\nthe right eye and high pressure with pain , and proliferative\nretinopathy with bilateral traction detachment. She was taking the\nfollowing medications: Pred Forte , Cosopt , ofloxacin , and Alphagan\nfor her eyes. On November , she had an Ophthalmology appointment\nfor floaters and that diagnosis was proliferative diabetic\nretinopathy , status post pan retinal phototherapy with vitreous\nhemorrhage. On March , she had an appointment with Dr. Saulsbury at\n506-198-7227 , who recommended to add timolol to her eye drops , and\nwill be following up with her.\n11. Dental: The patient had an appointment on August , where\nthey recommended a root canal of #18 and #19 for\ncaries. This root canal was done on March . The number of the\nclinic is 101-719-8131.\n12. Skin: The patient received Lotrimin , miconazole and wound\ncare to her right foot with Regranex. The left foot is\nreceiving wet-to-dries q.d.\n13. Tubes , lines and drains: The patient had a right PICC line\nplaced on March , 2002.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-5": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient received a 10 day course of ATGAM\ncomplicated by , during the first day , temperature\nto 105 with response to holding ATGAM and starting hydrocortisone\nand restarting ATGAM. She was afebrile without symptoms until day\nnine of ATGAM when a rash became apparent starting on her right\nforearm with a rectangular red erythematous maculopapular patch\nwhich later extended over her entire body and it was pruritic. No\ninvolvement of her orpharynx and no respiratory compromise were\never noted. This may have been partly secondary either to her\nATGAM being turned up on the night of 17 of May by the patient by\naccident or also may have been due to Ceftaz and Vanco which was\nstarted on 17 of May for a febrile episode on the eighth day of\nATGAM. She was also noted during the episode of fever to have an\nerythematous eardrum , a couple of posterior cervical nodes one\nmeasuring about 1 cm x 2 cm which was tender to palpation , also\nsome erythema of the right side of her oropharynx. Strep was\nnegative. The patient was treated with Ceftaz and Vanc for\npossible otitis. This was later changed to Augmentin when rash was\nthought to be possibly secondary to Ceftaz and then this again was\nchanged later to po Cipro when she was no longer neutropenic and\nher symptoms appeared to be resolving. During the episode of the\nrash her urine also changed to a dark coke-colored urine which\ncontained red blood cells , no casts were noted , however , it was\nfelt to be consistent with serum sickness and so the patient was\nchanged from the 40 mg prednisone started for the ATGAM so that she\nwould be afebrile and to minimize reaction of the ATGAM to IV Solu\nMedrol. She responded well to this with urine changing rapidly to\nyellow color still with some RBCs on discharge , however , she will\nbe discharged on 16 mg prednisone po bid and followed up in\nHematology to make sure the rash continues to fade and that her\nurine continues to improve. During hospitalization the patient\nrequired periodic transfusions for platelets and packed red blood\ncells. She tolerated the packed red blood cell transfusion well ,\nhowever , in general she noted her usual reaction to platelets with\nrigors and chills and was given hydrocortisone 100 mg IV at the\nsame time. Also while using Solu Medrol one night prior to\nadmission she was given one bag of platelets for which she\ndeveloped a little bit of an increased rash which faded rapidly on\nstopping the platelets and a platelet blood transfusion reaction\nworkup was done. The labs on discharge are sodium 135 , potassium\n4.8 , BUN 20 , creatinine 1 , LDH 327 , alk phos 263 , magnesium 2.1 ,\ncalcium 9.4 , white blood cell count 2.4 with 36 polys , 1 band , 55\nlymphs , and 8 monos , Hct 27.6 , and platelet count 7000 prior to one\nbag of platelets , MCV 88.",

The cancer was continued T-2 , N-0 , M-0 and was treated\nwith lumpectomy , XRT , and four cycles of CAF ending 1/10 .  She\nsuffered significant skin breakdown from the radiation therapy but\nimproved by 7/19 .  She represented in 3/18 with two areas of\nerythema with underlying lumps in the outer margin of her left\nbreast. At the time , it had the appearance of inflammatory breast\ncancer , but a biopsy turned out to be negative for cancer. She was\ntreated with three days of nafcillin intravenously in the hospital ,\nstarting in 0/28 and has been on oral dicloxacillin since then , so\nthat she could take antibiotics at home. Her skin changes have\nwaxed and waned since then so that some physicians involved in her\ncare felt there was improvement in her clinical condition , although\nthe patient subjectively felt there was none.\nMore recently , the patient's breast has swollen considerably and\nthe overlying skin has become erythematous and the erythema has\nspread to involve the entire breast and around to the back.

She went at a\nslow rate and did not complete stage one. She had 1/2 to 1 mm SP\ndepressions which were flat in one to two leads. She had some\nvague chest heaviness , which technically qualified as symptomatic ,\nhowever the technician stated that there suspicion was that it was\nmore fatigue. Because the chest was formally positive but with\nstill no suspicion for significant ischemia , a MIBI scan was\nperformed. This demonstrated mild ischemia with exercise in 4 of\n25 inferior segments only. After her GI distress resolved , the\npatient had no further episodes of chest pain. Although the\npatient may have some coronary artery disease , it is not felt that\nthis is actively symptomatic in her. She will be followed up in\nclinic and started on beta-blocker and/or nitrates if she has clear\nsymptoms of anginal pain.\nGastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with obvious\ngastroenteritis.

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-2": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 43 year old woman\nwith no significant past medical\nhistory who presented with fevers , chills , sweats , shortness of\nbreath , pleuritic chest pain , cough inducing vomiting of white to\nyellow fluid , myalgias , burning epigastric pain , and diarrhea all\nover the last five days. The source was the patient via Spanish\ninterpreter , the patient was a poor historian , and her old chart\nwas missing at the time of admission. She denied any cardiac or\npulmonary history though she did have an admission to the Ea Health in 1/28 for shortness of breath. Clinical\ndiagnosis was apparently flash pulmonary edema as she had a normal\nadmission chest X-Ray which later revealed mild pulmonary vascular\nredistribution consistent with congestive heart failure. She was\nruled out for a myocardial infarction and had an exercise tolerance\ntest which was negative for ischemic disease. She says she has had\nincreasing dyspnea on exertion over the past six weeks with\nsubsternal chest pain after climbing two flights of stairs.\nSeveral weeks ago and again the day of admission , she has had\ntwo-pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She was\nwell overall until five days ago when she started developing the\nfollowing symptoms: 1 ) \"Bone pain\" first in her hands and then\nall over. 2 ) Fevers ( although she did not take her temperature ).\n3 ) Chills. 4 ) Drenching sweats. 5 ) Anorexia. 6 ) Increasing\nshortness of breath worsening over the week. 7 ) Pleuritic chest\npain worse with inspiration and laying on her left side. 8 ) Cough\nand/or white vomitus ( one apparently induces the other but the\npatient cannot distinguish which ). 9 ) Nose bleeds. 10 ) Neck\npain. 11 ) Sore throat. 12 ) Burning epigastric pain. 13 )\nAbdominal bloating and diarrhea. 14 ) Black stools times one day.\n15 ) Overall malaise. She denies hemoptysis , weight loss ,\nphotophobia , neck stiffness , runny nose , sneezing , radiation of\nchest pain , dysuria , lower extremity edema , bright red blood per\nrectum , or melena. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative for asthma ,\ntuberculosis , or HIV risk factors. It is otherwise significant for\none episode of pulmonary edema of unclear etiology as noted above.\nHer echo at that time was significant for a left ventricular\nejection fraction of 54% with increased left atrial size and mild\nmitral regurgitation/aortic insufficiency. Her exercise tolerance\ntest was significant for not going nine minutes on a standard Bruce\nprotocol with a peak heart rate of 150 stopping secondary to\nfatigue with blood pressure of 170/80 and no chest pain or ischemic\nchanges. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Tylenol p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No\nknown drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Father with hypertension in\nhis sixties , mother died of a vaginal cancer at a young age ,\ndaughter has asthma , and brother has hypertension. SOCIAL HISTORY:\nShe is separated , lives with three of five children , works as a\ncleaning lady in various buildings in Ford , no tobacco , last\nsmoked at the age of 14 , and no alcohol or intravenous drug use.\nShe did have a history of exposure to typhus in her family\nrecently. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She had a weight gain of two pounds\nover the past two months , her last period was during the week prior\nto admission , and was shorter than usual.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-3": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  The patient had a temperature of 100.8 , a\nheart rate of 150 , blood pressure of 120/80 ,\nrespiratory rate of 30 to 35 , and O2 saturations of 93 to 96% on\nthree liters. She was mildly orthostatic on admission. GENERAL:\nShe was a tachypneic Spanish speaking woman in moderate respiratory\ndistress. HEENT: Remarkable for dry mucous membranes and a white\ncoating over her tongue but no erythema or exudate of her posterior\npharynx. NECK: Supple with tender submandibular shotty adenopathy\nbilaterally. No jugular venous distention or thyromegaly. LUNGS:\nRemarkable for diffuse crackles scattered throughout both lung\nfields , louder in the mid and lower lung fields bilaterally , and no\negophony or dullness. HEART: Remarkable for tachycardia and\nnormal S1 and S2 without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. BACK:\nRevealed mild tenderness to palpation at both costovertebral angles\nand there was no spinal tenderness. ABDOMEN: Soft with moderate\ntenderness to deep palpation in the epigastrium , there was no\nrebound or guarding , she had normal bowel sounds , no\nhepatosplenomegaly , no Murphy's sign , and no masses. EXTREMITIES:\nNo cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. SKIN: Without rash.",
        "NEUROLOGICAL-4": "NEUROLOGICAL  Examination showed her to be alert and oriented\ntimes three , cranial nerves II-XII were intact , and motor and\nsensory examinations were intact. There were no cerebellar\nfindings and her reflexes were 1+ of the upper extremities and 0 at\nthe knees with toes downgoing bilaterally.",
        "LABORATORY EXAMINATION-5": "LABORATORY EXAMINATION  On admission , sodium was 137 , potassium\n4.2 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 24 , BUN 15 ,\ncreatinine 0.9 , and glucose 145. Her white blood cell count was\n20.7 with 71 polys , 14 bands , 9 lymphocytes , 4 monocytes , and 2\nmetamyelocytes. Her hematocrit was 45% and her platelet count was\n322 , 000. Her room air blood gas revealed a pO2 of 66 , O2\nsaturation of 94.1% , pH of 7.46 , pCO2 of 34 , and an HCO3 of 25.\nEKG was remarkable for sinus tachycardia at 152 beats per minute\nwith flat T waves in her limb leads and V5 and V6 , there were no\nacute ST or T wave changes. When compared with prior EKG from\n1/28 , the rhythm was much faster but in sinus. Her chest X-Ray\nwas remarkable for diffuse interstitial lung disease , increased\ncompared with a prior chest X-Ray of 5/16 Her liver function\ntests were unremarkable on admission.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-6": "HOSPITAL COURSE  After admission , the patient was started on\nintravenous Bactrim and intravenous Erythromycin\nin Legionella doses to cover her broadly for this interstitial\npneumonia. Sputum inductions were done for toluidine blue , gram\nstain , and culture and sensitivity which were negative. An HIV\ntest was sent which was also negative making the diagnosis of PCP\nvery unlikely. She had Legionella antibody and urine antigens\nsent. Although the urine antigens are pending , the Legionella\nantibody came back positive at 1:256. At this titer , the diagnosis\nof legionnaires' disease was made. Until this titer came back ,\nhowever , the diagnosis was not as clear and the patient had a PPD\nplanted with anergy panel. This PPD was negative and the patient\nwas not anergic. Pulmonary consultation was obtaind to consider\nbronchoscopy as the patient could not produce sputum for the first\nseveral days of her admission. As she was improving , the decision\nwas made to hold off on bronchoscopy. A typhus antibody was sent\ngiven her possible exposure to typhus and that is still pending\nalthough unlikely to be the case given her improvement on Bactrim\nand Erythromycin and the fact that she has a positive Legionella\ntiter. Her gastrointestinal symptoms initially were felt to be\nprobably gastrointestinal complaints related to Legionella\nlegionnaires' disease. Stool cultures were sent and eventually\ncame back negative and she was started on intravenous Pepcid later\nswitched to p.o. Pepcid. She was also vigorously hydrated for her\nlosses in her diarrhea. The cause of her marked sinus tachycardia\nwas unclear although it was probably secondary to stress. Her\nheart rate eventually came down with fluids although she was not\nmarkedly orthostatic on admission. With fluid repletion , her heart\nrate did come down and subsequent EKG revealed that she was not in\nAV flutter with a 2:1 block but indeed was in sinus tachycardia.\nOver the subsequent days , her heart rate eventually normalized.\nHer O2 saturations initially were in the low nineties with three\nliters. With Erythromycin , her hypoxia markedly improved and by\nthe time of discharge , she was 98% on room air. As noted over the\nsubsequent days , she became afebrile with stable blood pressure and\nimproving respiratory rate and O2 saturations. This improvement ,\nhowever , took at least two to three days before it became clear\nthat she was heading in the right direction. During her early\ncourse , she started to have some abdominal distention with marked\ndiscomfort in her belly. A nasogastric tube was placed with\nsuction and she was made NPO. Her amylase and lipase were normal.\nMeanwhile , her white count did markedly improve and it appeared\nthat all of these symptoms were probably secondary to her primary\nlegionnaires' disease. Cold agglutinins eventually came back\nnegative and her Mycoplasma titers are pending. Subsequent chest\nX-Ray revealed that patient's process was at least radiographically\nstable although she was clinically better. As noted above , her\nwhite count improved and she remained afebrile except for single\nepisode of low grade fevers on 0/12 immediately prior to\ndischarge. She was thus watched for an additional day and was\ndischarged afebrile feeling well. Her course was also remarkable\nfor an increase in her ALT to 100 from a normal baseline probably\non the basis of Bactrim toxicity. After her Legionella titers came\nback as well as her HIV being negative , her Bactrim was stopped and\nshe was switched from intravenous to p.o. Erythromycin. She\ntolerated the switch well without any complications. She received\na total of seven days of intravenous Erythromycin and was\ndischarged with a two week course of p.o. Erythromycin.",

Most recently he was admitted in\nMarch of 1999 with an exercise tolerance test mibi , for which\nexercise for four minutes and seven seconds he had inferolateral\nischemia. Echocardiogram showed an left ventricular ejection\nfraction of 50 percent , anterior inferior posterior hypokinesis , 1\nto 2+ mitral regurgitation , pulmonary artery systolic pressure of\n42.0 millimeters of mercury plus right atrial pressure of 6.\nCatheterization showed 100 percent occlusion of his saphenous vein\ngraft to the diagonal one , which was stented. His right coronary\nartery and diagonal one were totally occluded. His left anterior\ndescending artery was 95 percent. His left circumflex was clear.\nAt that time he was randomized to the Airssylv Medical Center trial. At baseline ,\nMr. Dodwell denies exertional chest pain or any angina. He does get\nshort of breath with one flight of stairs , or going uphill for one\nblock. He gets claudication after walking three house lots.\nHe was in his usual state of health until one day prior to\nadmission when he noted the onset of 4/10 aching chest , shoulder ,\nand left arm pain while watching television , and it was associated\nwith shortness of breath. He sat still , waited for it to\ndissipate. At 7:00 p.m. , he took one sublingual nitroglycerin with\na decrease of pain. At 11:00 p.m. , he took one sublingual\nnitroglycerin and went to sleep before noting no change in the\npain. He was driving to his appointment with Dr. Stolberg , his\nprimary cardiologist on the morning of admission , with the return\nof the chest pain for one to two minutes and it was gone\nspontaneously. At Dr. Boulanger office , he was noted to have new\nlateral T wave inversions and was sent down to the Emergency Room\nfor admission.\nMr. Demik denies any associated nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis ,\nexertional or pleuritic chest pain currently , fever , chills , or\ncough. He does report stable lower extremity edema , but denies\northopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or palpitations. He has\npoor exercise tolerance.\nHis cardiac risk factors include the following: Age , diabetes ,\nhypertension , cholesterol , smoking , and family history.",

His\nTroponin was 0.45 , CK was 197 , his myoglobin was 159 , his INR was\n1.5.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-10": "HOSPITAL COURSE  In summary , this is a 73-year-old man with\nextensive coronary artery disease , who presents with one day of his\ntypical anginal pain , multiple bruits , new lateral T wave\ninversions , admitted for a rule out myocardial infarction. His\nhospital course by issue:\n1. Cardiovascular: Mr. Jinkerson was catheterized on the evening of\nadmission , and he was found to have the following. He was found to\nhave a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one was 100 percent\noccluded. Saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery\nwas open. His left main was 30 percent occluded. His left\nanterior descending artery was 99 percent occluded. His diagonal\none was 100 percent occluded. His left circumflex was 80 percent\noccluded. His left subclavian which was supplying his left\ninternal mammary artery was 100 percent occluded. He was taken\nback to the Catheterization Laboratory the next day with Dr.\nDevincenzo who performed a left subclavian artery stent and also a\nleft brachial artery angioplasty. Mr. Maheu tolerated this\nprocedure well. He had no return of his chest pain after the\nprocedure , and his pulses remained normal , he had no groin\nhematoma. He was placed on Plavix. He also continued his aspirin ,\nand his Coumadin was restarted after the heparin and intravenous\nTNG which were originally put on board to prevent arterial spasm\nafter the procedure , were discontinued. His next cardiovascular\nissue was his blood pressure. He was originally on atenolol 25\nmilligrams q.d. , we added back Cozaar 25 milligrams q.d. which he\nhad been on before admission and had been stopped a month prior\nbecause he had low blood pressure with a systolic in the 80s.\nHowever , his first day here , his systolic pressure was 120 to 130 ,\nand restarted it. He had no problems with that. His blood\npressure a few days after admission was in the 150 to 160 systolic\nover 70 , and amlodipine was added to his regimen. He was continued\non his outpatient doses of Lasix 160 milligrams q.a.m. and\nmitozalone 5 q.d. He ruled out for a myocardial infarction.\n2. Renal: After the first catheterization , Mr. Ong creatinine\nwent from 1.3 to 1.8. However , it went back to 1.3 the next day.\nAfter the second catheterization it went up to a peak of 4.3.\nHowever , his urine output remained at 100 to 150 cc an hour with\nLasix 100 milligrams intravenous p.r.n. , in addition to his morning\ndose of 160 milligrams q.a.m. , and he was given normal saline\nintravenous fluids to equalize his ins and outs. He did not have\nany signs of cholesterol emboli , no levator reticularis , no\neosinophilia , no blue toes.\n3. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: He had a low potassium on the\nmorning of admission with a potassium of 2.7 because he had missed\nhis outpatient K-Dur of 60 mEq q.d. He had no symptoms , he had no\nelectrocardiogram changes. He was repleted throughout admission\nand was kept on his outpatient dose of K-Dur and had no problems\nfurther with potassium. In addition , he was discharged on a\nstanding dose of magnesium because his magnesium was routinely low\nthroughout admission , on the order of 1.5 to 1.8.\n4. Hematology: On the day after his catheterization , his\nhematocrit dropped from 33.0 to 28.0. He was transfused two units\nwith an appropriate bump back to 33.0. He tolerated this without\nany problems.\n5. Diabetes: He was maintained on his outpatient regimen of NPH\n30/10 and 4 regular q.p.m. , and Rezulin. His blood sugars were\nmaintained throughout admission.\n6. Genitourinary: He was maintained on his finasteride for benign\nprostatic hypertrophy. In addition , he had a biopsy prior to\nadmission which had shown chronic prostatitis. His outpatient\nurologist had recommended ciprofloxacin 500 milligrams b.i.d. for\nthirty days. Since the hospital does not carry ciprofloxacin , we\nput him on Levofloxacin 500 milligrams q.d. He had no return of\nthose symptoms.\n7. Musculoskeletal: On hospital day number four , he developed\nexcruciating point tenderness in the medial aspect of his right\nknee. The knee did not appear swollen or red , and he had no source\nof trauma. However , it was thought it might be a recrudescence of\nhis gout. The next day it was more warm and slightly swollen.\nColchicine helped somewhat , and he was then put on a prednisone\ntaper starting at 40 milligrams and tolerated this well.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient came into the hospital , after\nadmission was taken to the operating room on 7/4/03 . In the\noperating room he underwent exploratory laparotomy biopsy of a\nportacaval lymph node. Uterolithotomy on the right side , liver\nbiopsy , cystoscopy , placement of double J ureteral stent on the\nright side and open nephrolithotomy. The large right ureteral\nstone was found upon exploration and urology was called for an\nintraoperative consult. Please see both Dr. Moriarity and Dr.\nCushard dictated reports for more information. There was a\nvery high amount of blood loss approximately 17 liters\nintraoperatively from venous plexus bleeding of the pelvis and\nkidney and the patient was closed after stomach mobilization\nwithout resection of his tumor and admitted to the Angeles Vandie Morepa surgical\nintensive care unit. The patient was left intubated due to his\nlarge fluid and blood product replacement and surrounding facial\nedema. He was kept intubated , paralyzed and sedated , started on\nLopressor , put on a rule out MI protocol , kept NPO with an\nNG-tube. His electrolytes , CBC and coagulation labs were\ncorrected. The patient had multiple abdominal drains and was\nkept on triple antibiotics. Over the next several days , the\npatient was kept intubated and sedated. His chest x-rays\nrevealed some early ARDS and he continued to need blood product\nincluding red cell and platelet and FFP transfusions. He\nunderwent bronchoscopy in the intensive care unit and was slowly\nweaned on his valve dilatory settings. Over postop day 4 , 5 and\n6 the patient began to spike some fevers up to 102. He had been\nweaned to pressure support ventilation and was beginning to auto\ndiurese. He then started on tube feeds of small amounts which\nwere increased as tolerated.\nOver the next couple of days as the patient's sedation was weaned\nand he woke up more , it was noticed that he had decreased\nmovement of his left lower extremity and upon examination and\ngiven his recurrent fevers , there was a question of an epidural\nhematoma. He was scheduled for an MRI to assess this. He was\ntolerating tube feeds well and these were increased and his labs\nwere stabilizing. Neurosurgery was consulted and it was\nascertained that the patient did have an epidural hematoma ,\ntherefore his epidural was removed and this was deemed likely to\nbe secondary to trauma from the epidural. It was decided that\nthe patient would benefit from evacuation of epidural hematoma\nand the patient was made NPO and taken back to the operating room\non 11/10/03 . He underwent a T5-T8 laminectomy with evacuation of\nthe epidural hematoma. Please see the dictated operative report\nfor more information , but a handful of clot was removed from the\narea. The patient was transferred back to Or Ox Nor , intubated and\nstable having tolerated the procedure well.\nThereafter , the patient was more awake and alert and more quickly\nweaned off his ventilatory support. His fingersticks were more\ndifficult to control and he was therefore started on the\nHeartland protocol and was seen by the Diabetes Management\nService. The patient was extubated on 0/2/03 and was doing well\non a face mask on that day. His tube feeds were restarted and\nspeech and swallow was consulted to evaluate the patient. He\nbegan to be seen by physical therapy for his lower extremity\nweakness. The Cardiology Service was consulted on 1/24 and asked\nto optimize medical management of the patient's ischemic\ncardiomyopathy. They recommended discontinuing and titrating the\npatient's Lopressor. He had been somewhat tachycardic previously\nand this resolved shortly. Speech and swallow saw the patient\nand initially cleared him for soft foods and thickened foods and\nthis was likely just due to endotracheal tube trauma. After\nanother day or two they cleared him for all regular foods\nincluding thin liquids without any restrictions.\nFor the patient's epidural hematoma , he had been started on\nVancomycin and it was decided that he would get a total of a\nthree week course of Vancomycin. Urology continued to followed\nthe patient and wanted at least one Blake drain kept in place and\nthe Foley catheter kept in place. The patient did have a CT scan\non 10/27/03 which demonstrated no urine leak on the CT urogram.\nThe patient continued to be seen by physical therapy every day\nand was doing very well. It was very difficulty initially to\nnormalize him but by the time of discharge he was up walking with\nthe walker with physical therapy and doing quite well.\nInfectious disease was consulted to confirm the three week course\nof Vancomycin was appropriate for the patient's epidural\nhematoma , and they agreed and thought no other interventions or\ntreatment as needed at the time. The patient was transferred out\nof the intensive care unit on 10/27/03 .\nNeuro: At this time he was getting increasingly more oriented.\nHe had had some ICU psychosis and confusion and he was taking no\npain medication. He was stable from his neurosurgery procedure\nand neurosurgery was following him.\nPulmonary: His lungs were clear. He was now stable on room air.\nFrom a cardiovascular standpoint , he was stable and continued on\nhis low dose Lopressor.\nGastroenterology: He was tolerating a house diet , eating small\namounts.",
        "GU-8": "GU  As stated , the urologist wanted to keep the Foley catheter\nand keep one of the Blake drains upon discharge.\nFrom a hematology standpoint , the patient had a stable\nhematocrit.

He had a PICC\nline placed on 11/0/03 which was put in good position.\nFrom an endocrine standpoint , he was placed on glyburide ,\ncontinued to be followed by diabetes and also on a humalog scale.\nFrom an activity standpoint , he was seen by physical therapy\nevery day.\nOver the ensuing few days he was begun on calorie counts to see\nhow much of the diet he was tolerating and he continued to work\nwith physical therapy. His glyburide and insulin doses were\ntweaked a little bit by the diabetes management service and he\nwas improving every day as was his mental status. He had been\ndischarged from the unit with a one-to-one sitter but this was\nvery soon thereafter stopped on 9/18/03 . He was stable medically\nabout 0/27 or 10/30/03 for discharge and was ______ for a\nrehabilitation facility appropriately. He was accepted to a\nrehab facility near his home on 5/17/03 , Dis University Hospital and was ready\nto go.\nFrom a neurologic standpoint , he is awake and oriented x3 most of\nhis time. His back limbs are stable. The staples have been\nremoved by neurosurgery and he will follow up with Dr. Ochwat\nfrom Neurosurgery in a couple of weeks. From a cardiovascular\nstandpoint , he has been restarted on all of his home medications\nand his blood pressure and heart rate had been stable on those.\nFrom a pulmonary standpoint , he currently has no issues and is\nbreathing well on room air. From a GI standpoint , he is\ntolerating an ADA diet with diabetic booster , Ensure and has been\neating fairly well the last couple of days. From a GU\nstandpoint , he is urinating sufficiently and he will keep his\nFoley catheter and Blake drain. From an endocrine standpoint , he\nis on glyburide twice a day and twice a day fingersticks with\nhumalog sliding scale. From an infectious disease standpoint , he\nhas a well functioning PICC and has been fine and will begin on\nVancomycin for a total of three weeks.

In the operating room ,\nthey found the left distal ureteral stricture , approximately 8\ncentimeters with a small stone cluster. The patient left the\noperating room in stable condition with a Foley to gravity , a\n7-French single pigtail external ureteral stent , as well as a\nJackson-Pratt drain to suction. Postoperatively , the patient did\nwell. She did have a low hematocrit in the immediate postoperative\nperiod requiring 2 units of blood. Her level was 21.9. Otherwise ,\nelectrolytes were stable and the patient was doing well. The\npatient was taken to the ward for the remainder of her\npostoperative care. We kept her on intravenous antibiotics and\nnothing-per-oral until she passed flatus , at which point she was\nable to tolerate a diet. Because of the duration of surgery , as\nwell as her large size , pulmonary toilet was encouraged with the\npatient. On postoperative day #3 , the patient persisted with a\nfever of unknown origin , again thought to be respiratory as\nmentioned above. Cultures were taken and she remained on\nantibiotics. Stentogram was done on postoperative day #10. This\nshowed extravasation of fluid distally in the ureter. Cystogram\nshowed no bladder extravasation. With that in mind , the Foley was\ntaken out and the stent was left in place. It was anticipated that\nshe would be taken back another time for stent removal. The\npatient was discharged on 5 of July The external stent had actually\nbeen switched over to an internal stent at the time of discharge.",

His cardiac risk factors include positive family history\nand a history of hypertension. He does not smoke tobacco and has\nno history of diabetes. Note that the patient is a very poor\nhistorian , however , through his mother , he complains of\napproximately three weeks of increasing fatigue and malaise. The\nweek prior to admission , he had a single episode of chest pain at\n\"work\" ( actually his day activity center ) which resolved\nspontaneously. Three days prior to admission , the patient had\npoorly defined chest pain with marked diaphoresis. This pain was\nworse with deep inspiration and , in addition , he had generalized\nnausea and malaise with shortness of breath. This pain waxed and\nwaned over the day and was not exertional in nature. He was seen\nat Childmiltrich Health Care where no laboratories were drawn and he was\nreferred to follow-up on Friday. One day before admission , the\npatient had chest pain radiating to the left upper arm with\nnumbness in that extremity. He had nausea and occasional\ndiaphoresis. He had an echocardiogram on that day at Tal Hospital which revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy but no\nregional wall motion abnormality and was otherwise normal. On the\nday of admission , the patient complained of increased severity of\nchest pain with shortness of breath. He \"felt sick\" but denied\nvomiting or diaphoresis. He came to the Sta Medical Center Emergency Room where he continued to complain of chest\npain radiating to the left shoulder as well as into the abdomen.\nThis symptom was worsened with inspiration as well as with central\nsternal palpation. At baseline , the patient does little exercise\nsecondary to his cerebral palsy , he has three-pillow orthopnea but\nno paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and he has no prior episodes of\nchest pain except as described above. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nSignificant for cerebral palsy as above and also for pneumonia in\n1986. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes no medications. ALLERGIES:\nHe has no allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke tobacco ,\nhe does not drink alcohol , and he does not use intravenous drugs.\nHe is a regular church goer , he lives with his mother , and attends\na day rehabilitation care center.

HEENT: The\noropharynx was clear , there was no jugular venous distention ,\ncarotids were 2+ and equal , pupils were equal , round , and reactive\nto light and accommodation , and the neck was supple without\nlymphadenopathy. The fundi were not well seen secondary to poor\ncooperation. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: There was a\nregular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 were heard , and there was a\nII/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.",

NEUROLOGICAL: He was alert and\noriented times three and he was unable to do simple calculations ,\nhowever , cranial nerves II-XII were intact. Sensory and motor in\nthe upper and lower extremities were within normal limits , reflexes\nwere brisk and symmetric , and toes went down.",
        "LABORATORY EXAMINATION-5": "LABORATORY EXAMINATION  EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with an\naxis of 0 degrees and normal intravals.\nThere was left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage in aVL and there\nwere no acute ST or T wave changes , however , there was no old EKG\nfor comparison. An SMA 7 was benign , a CK on admission was 283\nwith 10 MB , white count was 9.4 , and urinalysis was negative.\nChest X-Ray initially revealed evidence of pulmonary vascular\nredistribution , however , a repeat chest X-Ray an hour later was\nclear.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-6": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted to the floor and given\nhis rather indistinct complaints , a broad-based\nwork-up was initiated including a rule out for myocardial\ninfarction. Although the patient continued to have elevated CK\nwith elevated MB , these were electrophoresed and found not to be\nMB. There was concern given the pleuritic nature of his chest pain\nthat the patient may have suffered a pulmonary embolism. Lower\nextremity non-invasives were negative as was a VQ scan. The\npatient was kept on cardiac monitor until his rule out for\nmyocardial infarction was complete. Throughout his\nhospitalization , the patient continued to complain of diffuse body\npain as well as \"feeling sick\" , however , he continued to be\nafebrile with normal laboratories. On the second hospital day , the\npatient became aware of the fact that his mother had been admitted\nto an outside hospital for a rule out myocardial infarction. He\nbecame quite agitated and at that time complained of increasing\nabdominal pain. He was treated with laxatives and reassurance and\nseemed improved. On the fourth hospital day , it was felt that the\npatient was not suffering from any serious illness and that the\nmost dangerous entities had been ruled out. It was felt that he\nwas most likely suffering from a viral flu syndrome. His blood\npressure was controlled with a beta blocker and he was discharged\nin stable condition to home.",

PFT's during that admission showed\nFVC of 1.92 , 59% , FEV1 of 1.42 estimated at 55% and FEV1/FVC ratio\n94%. An echocardiogram performed during that admission showed\nnormal left and right ventricular function and size. Since her\ndischarge , Ms. Gieck has become progressively weak and has noted\ngradually increasing shortness of breath on exertion. She denies\nfevers and chills , reports a dry cough but no nausea or vomiting.\nThe cough was nonproductive. She has had poor oral intake , however ,\nno change in her bowel habits and no symptoms consistent with an\nupper respiratory tract infection. She denies any episodes of chest\npain , however , notes that she requires three pillows to sleep on ,\nnew onset orthopnea and new onset pedal edema. She presented to the\nSi to the emergency department after having\nincreased shortness of breath the night preceding the 3 of May and was\nnoted on arrival to the emergency room to have a blood pressure of\n200/100 with an oxygen saturation on 100% face mask of 85%.\nPortable chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure\nand she has been on Lasix , Morphine Sulfate , in addition to\nnebulizer treatment. She initially responded well to this\ntreatment , diuresing 1.4 liters in urine output and her O2\nsaturation rose to 96% on six liters. At that point , she was\ntransferred to the floor to the general medical service. PAST",

        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-6": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Obese , white female in mild respiratory\ndistress. Blood pressure 120/60 , heart rate\n120 , respiratory rate 16 , temperature 98 with oxygen saturation 94%\non three liters. HEENT exam was notable for normocephalic ,\natraumatic head. Extraocular movements were intact and pupils were\nequal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation. Oropharynx\nwas clear and sclera were also clear and anicteric. Neck exam was\nsupple. Jugular venous pressure was 10 cm and the carotids were\nwithout bruits. Neck was without adenopathy. Lungs; rales\none-half way up from the bases bilaterally. Cardiac exam showed\nthat she was tachycardic but with a regular rhythm and S1 and S2\nwere heard clearly with an S4 , there were no murmurs or rubs noted.\nAbdomen; notable for positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender ,\nnon-distended , no hepatosplenomegaly and no other masses felt.\nExtremities; 2+ pitting edema bilaterally with 1+ DP and PT pulses\nbilaterally without femoral bruits. Rectal exam showed no masses\nand was guaiac negative. Neuro exam; alert and oriented x3.\nCranial nerves were bilaterally intact and motor strength was 5 out\nof 5 , and sensation was grossly intact as well as her coordination.\nReflexes were symmetric and toes were bilaterally down-going.",
        "LABORATORY EVALUATION-7": "LABORATORY EVALUATION  On admission , sodium was 142 , potassium 4.6 ,\nchloride 106 , bicarbonate 24 , BUN 13 ,\ncreatinine 0.7 , glucose 220. LFT's were within normal limits.\nAlbumin was 3.1 , calcium 9.0 , cholesterol 208 , triglycerides 220.\nCBC showed a white count of 16 with hematocrit of 34.3 and\nplatelets 352 , MCV 91. The differential on her white count\ndemonstrated 82 polys , 12 lymphocytes , 5 monocytes , 1 eosinophil.\nHer first CK was 33 with no MB fraction and an arterial blood gas\n/showed pH of 7.41 , 31 , 77 , 23 , and 96%. Chest x-ray was consistent\nwith congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions and\nincreased pulmonary vascular redistribution. EKG showed sinus\ntachycardia at 120 with normal intervals and axis , with some\nflattening in the STT waves in the lateral lead. Urinalysis was\nnegative.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  Patient was initially admitted to the floor where\nshe received another dose of IV Lasix and 30 mg\npo Nifedipine. Twenty minutes later , patient was noted to be\nhypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 70. She was given a\nsmall IV bolus of 100 cc normal saline with no response to her\nsystolic blood pressure. She was noted to be nauseated and vomited\nx1 with midscapular back pain but no chest pain. She was markedly\ndiaphoretic , but did not complain of palpitations. Her blood sugar\nwas 181 and EKG at that time showed further T-wave flattening in\ninferior leads. She was started on Dopamine 20 micrograms per\nkilograms with initially no response. At that time , she was\ntransferred to cardiac unit for further management. In the CCU ,\nshe was weaned from IV Dobutamine and her blood pressures rapidly\ncame up to systolic blood pressure of 130. Her requirement for\noxygen was weaned from 100% face mask to 3 liters via nasal\ncannula , with her O2 saturations remaining 94-95%. She was started\non a beta blocker and her rule out protocol for myocardial\ninfarction showed flat CK's , CK's numbering 33 , 58 , and 147 , with\nno MB fractions and no further EKG changes , and no further episodes\nof nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis. On the third hospital day ,\nshe was transferred to the cardiology Lan Tempeo service. Soon after\ntransfer , a routine 12 lead EKG revealed deepening and inversion of\nT-waves in the lateral leads , as well as the inferior leads. Her\nheart rate at that time was 110 , blood pressure 130/90. She did not\ncomplain of chest pain , shortness of breath , or diaphoresis.\nPatient was given one tablet of sublingual Nitroglycerin with no\nchange in her heart rate and her blood pressure went to 180/60 and\nshe complained of a headache. She was given 5 mg IV push Lopressor\nq 5 minutes x3 with response of her heart rate to 90. EKG post\nintervention was without change and she was maintained on 3 liters\noxygen via nasal cannula , without change in her O2 saturation. At\nthat time , the patient was started on Heparin 5 , 000 units IV bolus\nand maintained at 1200 units per hour , and a rule out protocol was\nagain started. Her CK's were flat and there were no further EKG\nchanges. The decision to proceed with cardiac catheterization was\npresented to the patient and on the 4th hospital day , the patient\ninitially refused cardiac catheterization. However , after further\nconsideration , she agreed to cardiac catheterization on the 7th\nhospital day , 1/0/93 .  Because of her history of acute renal\nfailure with creatinine rising from baseline of 1 to 1.7 on\nprevious admission with the initiation of Captopril , she had\nconcurrently an abdominal aortogram to rule out renal artery\nstenosis. Her right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary\ncapillary wedge pressure of 15 with a diffusely diseased left\ncoronary system , right coronary with serial stenoses of 50%\nproximal and 30% distal , and anterior apical hypokinesis with\npreserved LV systolic function. An echocardiogram revealed\nanteroseptal akinesis at the apex without any mention of thrombus ,\nmoderately dilated left ventricle with ejection fraction estimated\nat 30%. It was felt at this time that the patient had suffered\nmyocardial infarction at the time between her two Sadam Medical Center admissions. Her catheterization results suggested that\nshe would be best managed medically and her hospital course then\nwas notable for aggressive diuresis with Lasix and one time dose of\nZaroxolyn , and rate control initially with Diltiazem with moderate\nsuccess and then by the 7th hospital day the addition of Lopressor.\nPatient diuresed well with loss of 2-3 kilograms and with decrease\nin her oxygen requirement was able to be weaned to room air with\noxygen saturations 92-93%. By the time of her discharge , her O2\nsaturation was 95% on room air and she was able to ambulate without\nassistance or complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.",
        "ID-9": "ID  On admission , patient's white blood cell count was noted to be\n16 and it was persistently high throughout the first four or\nfive days of her hospital course. She remained afebrile until the\n6th hospital day , when she was noted to have one temperature of\n101. Blood culture , urine culture , sputum , and chest x-ray did not\nreveal any evidence of infection and patient's white count was\nnoted to fall to 9.8. No IV antibiotics were given.\nDIABETES; Patient was maintained on her normal dose of insulin\nand except for the day when she went to catheterization ,\nand covered with CZI sliding scale. Her blood sugars initially ran\nin the 200 to 300 range but by the end of admission she was more\nwell controlled between 100 and 200 , and did not require addition\nof CZI sliding scale. Of note , patient had described previous\nincidences of feeling diaphoretic and hungry in which she would eat\npresumably secondary to hypoglycemia. After starting her beta\nblocker , she continued to have these sensations of hypoglycemia and\nif so , it was though to be safe to continue with the beta blocker\ntreatment.\nPERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE; Patient has a history of femoral\nstenosis and had been suggested that\nshe have a femoral angioplasty several years previously. Patient\nrefused that procedure at the time and has had no further\ncomplications. During this admission a renal arteriogram was\nperformed , which showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis with a\nmild non-flow in the stenosis in the right renal artery. Renal\ncortex was smooth by arteriography.",
        "DISPOSITION-10": "DISPOSITION  There were no complications. Patient was able to\nambulate and was stable on discharge. Her congestive\nheart failure was largely resolved , and she was discharged to home\nwith follow-up to be with Dr. Carson Sequin in CARDSPAR MEDICAL CENTER Clinic.",

Pulmonary: The source of his hemoptysis was initially\nunclear. His sputum looked only blood tinged on the admission\nexam , but the patient reported bright red blood prior to\nadmission. His chest x-ray from the outside hospital looked like\na right hilar prominence , which was read as a possible mass , but\na repeat study done in the emergency room at the Crantlupethes Tyli Medical Center showed\nonly pulmonary congestion and no mass or acute process. He has\nvery minimal history of smoking cigarettes in the past. He was\ntoo large to fit into a CAT scan machine , so he underwent a V/Q\nscan , which demonstrated low probability for pulmonary embolus.\nThe pulmonary service was consulted and their impression was that\nhis hemoptysis was likely secondary to severe pulmonary\nhypertension but not a mass or infection. They opted not to\nperform a bronchoscopy and recommended starting sildenafil for\npulmonary hypertension. The Gini Shawn Health , the Pulmonary\nHypertension Service was then consulted. They did not recommend\nthe sildenafil so that was actually not started. They did\nrecommend starting torsemide 80 b.i.d. for better diuresis and\nthis was initiated and resulted in good urine output. His home\ndose of diuretic was 80 mg of Lasix daily. Upon discharge , he\nwas sent home on 80 mg of Lasix twice a day with recommendations\nto have his blood drawn , to measure electrolytes within a week ,\nand follow up with his PCP as soon as possible. The Gentm. Cathege Charleba Medical Hospital\nrecommended an outpatient cath and he was instructed to follow up\nwith them. He also reports a history of sleep apnea and BiPAP\nuse at home , although he admits that he does not use the BiPAP\nmachine. He was set up with BiPAP and nighttime oxygen inhouse\nand he was continued on Coumadin for his history of pulmonary\nemboli. His Coumadin was held initially on admission in the\nsetting of hemoptysis , but it was restarted after the V/Q scan\nwas low probability. He was also placed on a heparin drip while\nthe Coumadin was not therapeutic. He was discharged on 12 mg of\nCoumadin daily.\n2. Cardiovascular and hypertension: He was continued on his\nhome meds.\n3. Infectious disease: He did develop bilateral lower extremity\nerythema and tenderness on 7/8/05 and he was started on IV\nAncef 2 g q.8 h. for presumed cellulitis.

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-1": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  This is a 22 year old , gravida V para\n0314 , at 24 weeks , now with severe\nfrontal headache and scintillations. Dating is by the last\nmenstrual period and an early ultrasound which placed her at\napproximately 24 weeks. She presented with a three and a half day\nhistory of severe frontal headaches with scintillations. There was\nno relief with Tylenol , aspirin or Fioricet. She also stated she\nhad marked polydipsia for four days. She denied abdominal pain or\nswelling. She has a history of preeclampsia with a previous twin\ngestation. She does note fetal activity. At this juncture , I\nshould note that much of this history is as per patient and is\nsomewhat unreliable. PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY: C-section for\ntwins; previous C-section for singleton; history by patient of\npreeclampsia. PAST HISTORY: Initially she admitted to no past\nmedical problems , however , upon reviewing her chart the following\nis obvious: chronic hypertension; seizure disorder following motor\nvehicle accident for which she is on valproic acid , no clearly\ndocumented recent seizures; history of asthma for which she takes\nmedicines p.r.n.; history of behavioral disorders with question of\npseudoseizures in the past; obesity; multiple drug allergies;\ncholecystectomy in 1990; appendectomy at age 14; motor vehicle\naccident with V-P shunt placement in 1980; facial reconstruction\ntimes three in 1980; superficial vascular surgery in 1989 for\nvaricosities of the lower extremities. SOCIAL HISTORY: She denies\ntobacco , ethanol or drug use.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-2": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Revealed an obese white female in mild\ndistress. The pupils are equal , round and\nreactive to light and accommodation; fundi well visualized , no\npapilledema. Good facial movements. No oral lesions. The chest\nwas clear. The heart showed a regular rate and rhythm. The\nabdomen was soft and nontender with a fetal heart rate in the\n140's. The extremities showed trace edema. The neuro exam showed\ncranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. Reflexes were 1+ without\nclonus. The strength was reduced to 4/5 in the right upper and\nright lower extremities , however , the exam was questionable as she\nseemed to have a varying exam depending on the examiner and time of\nexam. She also demonstrated decreased fine finger movements on the\nright.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-3": "HOSPITAL COURSE  Problem #1 ) Headache. The patient has a history\nof chronic headaches for which she was maintained\non Fioricet in the past. Over the first week of hospitalization ,\nshe complained of increasing headache that prevented her from\nlooking into the light as well as prevented her from ambulating out\nof the bed. At times , she complained of intermittent visual\nsymptoms. These headaches were not completely relieved by Demerol ,\nPercocet or Tylenol. She was eventually tried on Fioricet which\napparently produced good relief of the headaches. She was seen by\nneurology and noted with a questionably abnormal neuro exam with\nfindings localized to the right side. Apparently she has a history\nof this abnormality in the past. A CT scan revealed what was\napparently old damage from the previous motor vehicle accident. An\nMRI was entirely within normal limits. She refused a lumbar\npuncture. At this time , the headaches are thought to be either\nvascular in origin or psychogenic. She was continued on Fioricet\nat the time of discharge. Problem #2 ) Hypertension. She had\nelevated blood pressures of 150-160 over as high as 110 upon\nadmission. She has a history of chronic hypertension in the past\nand was at least briefly maintained on hydrochlorothiazide before.\nShe had a negative work up for PET , including repeat 24 hour urines\nand repeat PET labs. As well , she had no physical findings\nconsistent with PET. Given her history of chronic hypertension , we\nfelt this was most likely chronic hypertension aggravated by\npregnancy. She was begun on a beta blocker , namely labetolol , with\ngood control. She was discharged to home on labetolol. Problem\n#3 ) History of seizure disorder. She carries the diagnosis of a\nseizure disorder , although this is , at least recently , poorly\ndocumented. She has been on valproic acid in the past and has been\ntaking a small dose of valproic acid apparently on her own\nthroughout this pregnancy. She has been taking 250 mg a week. She\nlast noted an obvious seizure three years ago. It is not clear\nthat this was witnessed by anyone else. While in the hospital , she\nhad an EEG which suggested some slowing in the right parietal\nregion. There was no clear seizure activity seen on EEG. She\ncalled us to her room on several episodes which she described as\nseizures. These seizures were witnessed by several physicians and\nwere remarkable for absence of a postictal period as well as\nabnormal idiosyncratic behaviors during the events. It was our\nfeeling that these were not true seizures. Indeed , reviewing her\nchart , she has had episodes of what have been called pseudoseizures\nsimilar to these in the past. Given her multiple drug allergies ,\nincluding Dilantin , phenobarb and tegretol , we felt limited in our\ntherapeutic options. We did elect to increase her dose of valproic\nacid as this has apparently been effective in the past. She will\ncontinue this as an outpatient. Problem #4 ) Nausea and vomiting.\nShe complained of persistent nausea and vomiting during the latter\npart of her hospitalization and declined to take anything p.o. The\netiology of this nausea and vomiting was unclear , although\napparently associated with some diarrhea. As much as was possible ,\nwork up for an organic cause of the problem was negative. We\nelected initially to treat her with intravenous hydration , however ,\nshe declined further IV's. In fact , she became quite vocal in her\ndemand to go home. She understands our concerns as to the risks of\npoor p.o. intake and insists she will be able to take in p.o.'s at\nhome. Given her feelings in this regard , we have elected to\ndischarge her for a trial of outpatient management. Follow up will\nbe in the clinic. Should she show evidence of compromise or\ndehydration , she will be readmitted. Problem #5 ) Psychosocial.\nThe patient has been seen several times in the past for behavioral\ndisorders. It is difficult to sort out what part of her\nsymptomatology is organic and what , if any , is inorganic. She was\nseen by psychiatry during her stay here who felt that she had a\nsignificant conflict in her home life. We have counseled her as\nmuch as possible throughout her stay. She has seen both social\nservices and psychiatry , however , she is at best reluctant to avail\nherself of these services. Our plan at the time of discharge is\nfor follow up with DSS. As well , we have emphasized our\navailability to the patient at all times and tried to be as\nsupportive as possible in these circumstances.",
        "DISPOSITION-4": "DISPOSITION  The patient was discharged for a trial of management\nat home. The etiology of her discomfort is somewhat\nobscure , however , we have as best as possible ruled out obvious\nmajor organic pathology , including PET , central CNS processes and\nfulminant hypertension.",

Labetolol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. was added to his\nantihypertensive regimen this admission and the patient's blood\npressure was reasonably well controlled throughout the admission.\n2. Infectious disease: The patient is being empirically treated\nfor likely cavitary pneumonia that was observed upon chest CT.\nThe patient has clinically improved on ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o.\nq.d. and will be discharged on a 7-day course of the same. The\npatient also has a history of C. difficile colitis and has been\ntreated with Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. during this admission and\nwas discharged on a 14-day course of the same. Blood cultures\nduring this admission have been negative to date. The patient\nwas PPD negative and induced sputum was negative by acid fast\ntests for evidence of tuberculosis.\n3. GI: The patient complained of left lower quadrant pain prior\nto dialysis on 6/22 and some involuntary guarding was apparently\nappreciated. CT of the abdomen ruled out\nan acute abdominal process and the patient has been without\nabdominal pain throughout the rest of the hospitalization. The\npatient's laboratory studies are notable for an elevated alkaline phosphatase\nwith unclear etiology. The patient has no Murphy\nsign or other signs of cholecystitis that could be appreciated.\n4. Neurology: The patient presented with altered mental status\non admission. He was confused and somnolent. Within 2 days of admission , he\nwas much improved and was alert and oriented x3.\nThe altered mental status was most likely secondary to pneumonia.\nThe patient reportedly had a tonic-clonic seizure in\nhemodialysis on 8/8/06. Neurology was consulted and thought\nthis was most likely secondary to fluid , electrolytes shifts in\ndialysis. The patient had both EEG and brain MRI , which were\nnormal during this admission.\n5. Renal. The patient has end-stage renal disease on\nhemodialysis and dialysis was continued Monday , Wednesday and\nFriday according to his usual schedule.\n6. Endocrine. The patient is a brittle type 1 diabetic and\nearly in his hospital course , he had frequent episode of\nhypoglycemia which responded to an AMP of D50. the patient's\ninsulin regimen at the time of discharge , on which his sugars were\nreasonably well controlled without episodes of hypoglycemia , was\nLantus 4 units q.a.m. Lantus 4 units q.p.m. with NovoLog 3 units\nwith breakfast and 3 units with lunch and NovoLog 2 units with\ndinner and sliding scale NovaLog used only when fingersticks were\ngreater than 400.\n7. Pulmonology The patient has left lower lobe cavitary\nlesion observed on chest CT that may be malignant , although it\nmost likely represented pneumonia. He needs to follow up chest\nCT in 6-8 weeks to confirm if this lesion was pneumonia and that\nit has completely resolved.\nThe patient had a history of COPD/asthma and continued on Advair during this\nadmission.\nAt the time of discharge , the patient was afebrile with heart rate\nin the 90s , systolic pressure ranging from 140-160/60-80 and\nsaturating 97% to 100% on room air.",

The right heart catheterization\nshowed the following: Right atrial pressure was 8 , right\nventricular pressure 35/5 , PA pressure 37/17 , and wedge pressure of\n15. The left heart catheterization showed two vessel coronary\nartery disease , no obstructive lesions. The patient showed marked\nclinical improvement with diuresis with IV Lasix. Prior to\ndischarge the Lasix was changed from IV to p.o. and the patient was\nstable on p.o. regimen of Lasix prior to discharge. The left heart\ncatheterization , as noted above showed moderate coronary artery\ndisease. The patient was continued on statin for this reason. The\npatient had had two syncopal episodes prior to admission along with\na run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia at the outside\nhospital.

Since her discharge in November ,\nshe had been complaining of increasing shortness of breath and on\nthe Friday prior to admission , she was at her usual dialysis\nappointment where she got a transfusion of packed red blood cells\nand intravenous iron when she began to feel \"warm all over\". The\nfollowing night , her son noted her to be rigorous and she felt the\npresence of fever. She was brought to the emergency room having\nreceived three sublingual nitroglycerin en route for shortness of\nbreath. Her initial vital signs showed a 90% oxygen saturation on\nroom air and an axillary temperature of 100 degrees. Her blood\npressure and heart rate were stable at 150/75 and 83 respectively.\nIn the emergency room , she became increasingly dyspneic with an\narterial blood gas of pH 7.26 , pCO2 of 64 , pO2 of 84 and was\nsubsequently intubated for respiratory distress. She also received\nheparin in the setting of a questionable pulmonary embolus. She\nhad a few runs of ventricular tachycardia and became bradycardic to\nthe 50s. Lidocaine 100 mg x 1 was given in the emergency room.",

She was\nadmitted with fever , chills and shortness of breath on August ,\n2001 requiring intubation for three days , pressor support ,\nNeo-Synephrine and dopamine for two days , but was then successfully\nextubated and weaned off the pressors for management outside the\nintensive care unit. Her course in the medical intensive care unit\nwas complicated by rule in non-Q wave myocardial infarction thought\nto be secondary to sepsis and hypotensive state. Her troponins\nmaxed in the 6-7 range , but this episode resolved without\nsignificant EKG changes. She was titrated up on a beta blocker and\ngiven Plavix in place of aspirin as she has an allergy to aspirin.\nShe was also continued on her statin. The patient would likely\nbenefit from further outpatient work-up of her cardiac status once\nher rehabilitative course is complete , i.e. imaging and stress.\nHer last catheterization was four years ago showing three vessel\nstenoses of about 40-50%. She is currently getting hemodialysis\nnow through her arteriovenous fistula and getting dosed with\nvancomycin at hemodialysis for the next four to six weeks. She had\nserially positive blood cultures for methicillin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus. The last was on February , but had\nnegative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal\nechocardiogram ( i.e. no vegetations ). She received gentamicin\nbriefly in addition to the vancomycin until two consecutive\nsurveillance cultures were negative and is now off the gentamicin.\nShe was noted to have a loud neck murmur and had both venous and\narterial ultrasounds which were negative for septic clot or\nsignificant stenosis respectively. Otherwise , her post medical\nintensive care unit course was uncomplicated and we restarted her\ninsulin regimen as her appetite increased. The patient is due for\nhemodialysis on tomorrow , Wednesday , January , 2001. She needs\nfollow up with her primary care physician for further cardiac\nevaluation , titration of her diabetes medications and follow up of\nher lipids , diabetes and hypertension. Of note , the patient has\nrefused to give the name of her primary care physician and does not\nwant to return to her care.

At that time , she received tailored therapy with\nDigoxin , diuretics and ACE inhibitors. In February of 1997 , she\nwas again hospitalized , this time with severe pancreatitis\nresulting in acute renal failure , hypotension and respiratory\nfailure requiring intubation in the ICU. In May of 1997 , she\ndeveloped progressive dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and PND. In\nMarch of 1998 , repeat echocardiogram revealed severe left\nventricular dilatation with an EF of 10 to 15% , global hypokinesis\nand left atrial dilatation secondary to mitral regurgitation. She\nwas hospitalized most recently in November 1999 for abdominal\ndiscomfort thought to be secondary to worsening right heart failure\nand improved with aggressive diuresis.\nShe has done well since then until approximately three weeks prior\nto admission when she developed worsening dyspnea and intermittent\ntachycardia.

This resulted in\na moderate diuresis and resolution of her shortness of breath\nsymptoms. She then underwent an exercise test. This was done with\narm ergometry ( 30 watts ). She went ten minutes , stopped secondary\nto arm fatigue. Her heart rate went from 100 to 129 , blood\npressure went from 130 systolic to 172. Electrocardiogram showed\nno ischemic changes. She had no chest pain or chest pressure with\nthis and this was deemed a negative test. She then underwent an\nechocardiogram which showed vigorous systolic function of 86% , no\nvalvular lesions , no wall motion abnormalities. There was evidence\nof thickening in her ventricular walls.\nGiven the fact that the patient had an elevated diastolic pressure\nand did show some early evidence of thickening in her ventricular\nwalls , the decision was then made to begin her on a calcium channel\nblocker.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported\nto the cardiac surgery ICU.\nPostoperatively , the patient's course was significant for acute and\nchronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a low ejection\nfraction , congestive heart failure , and volume overload. The\npatient was weaned off of epinephrine and diuresed accordingly. He\nwas subsequently transferred to the stepdown unit after several\ndays in the ICU. He continued to progress well with the additional\ndiuresis. His chest tubes and wires were removed without\ndifficulty.

        "BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-5": "BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS \nThe patient is a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who presents with\nshortness of breath and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for\napproximately three weeks. He has a history of coronary artery\ndisease with an MI in 1994 and four-vessel CABG with subsequently\nplaced five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis ,\nhypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline\ncreatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) ,\nhyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. He\nis presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea ,\nand paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightness\nwithout radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent.\nHe presents after coming to an outside hospital with three to\nfour days of these worsening symptoms. He was transferred to\nBaspit Hospital where he received most of his\ncardiac care. The patient had these worsening heart failure\nsymptoms after a trip to I Hwy , Ny Vale , Michigan 34152 , some dietary indiscretion and\na five-pound weight gain. He has had no syncope , palpitations ,\nbut has had some mild nausea without emesis. At the outside\nhospital when he presented , his EKG showed a baseline left\nbundle-branch block and had a troponin of 0.13. He was given\nsome Lasix and had echocardiogram , had initially revealed an\nejection fraction of 35%. He was transferred to Me Ale Firstray Hospital , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as a\nheparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeat\nechocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior wall\ndistal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction and\nmoderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. This is consistent with\nan echocardiogram that he received in 7/25 . Upon\npresentation , the patient was afebrile , had a heart rate of 82 ,\nblood pressure of 138/64 and was sating 96% on 5 liters of nasal\ncanula. His jugular venous pressure was 7 cm. His lungs had\nrales bilaterally , approximately half way up. He had no\ndullness. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6\nholosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the left\naxilla. He had no S3 , and no S4. His abdomen was mildly\ndistended. He had no fluid waves and positive bowel sounds. His\nextremities were warm. He had no pedal edema and 1+ dorsalis\npedis pulses bilaterally. EKG at Baneers Hospital\nrevealed a dual chamber pacemaker with left bundle-branch pattern\nand no significant ST wave changes and an occasional PVC.",
        "ADMISSION LABORATORIES-6": "ADMISSION LABORATORIES \nSignificant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a BUN of 76 , potassium of\n5.3 , his hematocrit was 29.4 , and PT-T was 56 on heparin drip.",
        "BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. Ischemia. The patient has an extensive history of coronary\nartery disease. He is maintained on aspirin , Plavix , low dose\nbeta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ACE inhibitor and statin.\nHe initially came in with a troponin of 0.13 , which was felt as\ndemand ischemia related to systemic hypertension and pulmonary\nhypertension. His enzymes trended down and were negative after\nthe initial check. Eventually , the patient received 48 hours of\nintravenous heparin as well as IV nitroglycerin and was chest\npain free. At this point , he received an Adenosine MIBI nuclear\nstudy , which revealed a known distal anterior wall scar with a\nvery small surrounding region of reversible ischemia that was\nfelt to be nonrevascularizable. He was maintained on optimum\nmedical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterization\nin this gentleman who had already had previous history of renal\ndysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye load\nwas not warranted nor indicated at this time. By discharge , he\nwas ambulating halls and was chest tightness free. Coronary\nartery disease was felt to be a noncontributory factor to his CHF\nexacerbation.\n2. Pump. The patient had an ejection fraction of 45% upon\nadmission with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. He was\ninitially diuresed approximately 3 liters with a combination of\nLasix and Natrecor. At this point , his pulmonary edema had\nresolved and his oxygen requirement was decreased. Given the\nfact of his tenuous renal status , we wanted to avoid further\ndiuresis or after-load reduction until we knew exactly what his\nright and left heart filling pressures were. The patient was\ntaken to the Cardiovascular Diagnostic Laboratory and received a\nright heart catheterization. His pulmonary capillary wedge\npressure was determined to be 16 and his pulmonary artery\npressure 56/18. His RA pressure was 8. There was some initial\nfalse elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cath\nlab , and the patient was transferred for 48 hours of tailored\ntherapy to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a pulmonary artery\ncatheter in place. At this point , his after-load reduction was\nmaximized with combination of hydralazine and Isordil with good\neffect. His creatinine decreased with after-load reduction to\n2.7. His symptoms improved and we were able to diurese another 2\nliters of the patient. By discharge , the patient was actually\nbecoming hypertensive again and he was started on amlodipine , a\ncalcium channel blocker , which he has tolerated in the past. Of\nnote , the patient has been exposed to ACE inhibition in the past\nand is currently not on an ACE inhibitor. In the past , he had\nhad a rise in his potassium to 5.5 on ACE inhibition. On an\noutpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient have\na trial of ACE or ARB to optimize his after-load reduction and\nneurohormonal activation with his heart failure. The patient's\nheart failure regimen includes standing Lasix , carvedilol ,\nIsordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomatic\nimprovement.\n3. Rhythm. The patient has a dual-chambered pacemaker. He was\nmaintained on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. His\nelectrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker.\nHe had a few rounds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia less\nthan 8 beats every time during his hospital stay. The patient is\nnot at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricular\npacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45% , even if his\nQRS interval is greater than 150 ms.\n4. Pulmonary. Given the fact that the patient had a normal\npulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary artery\npressures , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal disease\nwas undertaken. He had a high resolution chest CT , which showed\nmild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent with\npulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process. He also\nhad pulmonary function tests. Pulmonary function tests revealed\nan FVC of 1.88 liters and an FEV1 of 1.33 liters. This gives an\nFEV1 to FVC percent of 71%. He has both decreased FVC and FEV1 ,\nbut an FEV1 and FVC percent that is most consistent with a mild\nrestriction. His lung volumes are approximately 50% predicted\nsuggestive of a restrictive process and his DLCO both corrected\nand uncorrected are 50% predicted. His corrected DLCO is 13.5.\nIt is unclear if the patient has underlying restrictive lung\ndisease given the absence of definitive interstitial process on\nhigh resolution chest CT. A more likely explanation for these\nfindings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequate\ndiuresis with his congestive heart failure. The patient was\nsating 98% on room air at the time of discharge.\n5. Endocrine. The patient has very difficult to control\ndiabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both NPH and Lispro\nsliding scale while in house. He was briefly hypoglycemic during\nhis initial hospital course because of a urinary tract infection.\nThis resolved after approximately 24 hours of holding his\nlong-acting insulin and giving him glucose replacement therapy.\nHe was euglycemic on 15 and 10 of NPH in the a.m. and p.m.\nrespectively as well as a Lispro scale at the time of discharge.\nFurthermore , the patient was found to have a TSH of 0.219 as well\nas a normal T4 , this is suggestive of clinical hypothyroidism ,\nwhich is consistent with over replacement with Synthroid such as\nmaintenance Synthroid dose is decreased from 75 mcg to 60.5 mcg\nand we recommend a TSH to be checked in late February 2004.\n6. Renal. The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency\npresumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension. He\nhas had adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with a\ncreatinine bump to nearly 7. We wanted to avoid as much contrast\ndye as possible during this hospital stay because of his renal\ninsufficiency. We ended up re-dosing his digoxin to three times\nweekly from every other day because of the dig level of 0.19.\nHis creatinine was 2.7 and falling at the time of discharge and\nhis BUN was 67. He was making good urine and had no evidence of\nresidual urinary tract infection.\n7. Infectious disease. Upon presentation , the patient after a\nFoley was placed became a little delirious and hypoglycemic.\nUrine cultures grew out greater than 100 , 000 colonies of Serratia\nmarcescens and he was given a 14-day course of renally dosed\nlevofloxacin with good resolution of his symptoms.\n8. Neuropsych. The patient has a history of depression and had\nsome mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection ,\nwhich resolved with p.r.n. Zyprexa as well as treating of the\nunderlying condition. Psychiatric Service was consulted and felt\nlike he had a resolving medical delirium and there is no\nindication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at this\ntime. ( His mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contributed\nto his low mood as apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman of\nthis age is not uncommon. )\n9. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Nexium for GI\nprophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.",

There are no skin marks\nnoted at the scene. There was airbag deployment , and the patient\nwas wearing a seatbelt. The patient reports feeling \"fine\" prior\nto the motor vehicle collision. However , he has no recollection\nof the motor vehicle collision itself , and the next thing he\nremembers is waking up and finding the airbag is deployed , and\nbeing in severe pain. He does remember EMS arriving.\nUpon arrival of the EMS , he was found to have a heart rate of 30\nin a third-degree AV block. The patient denies any chest pain ,\nshortness of breath , nausea or vomiting before the motor vehicle\ncollision.

        "LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION-13": "LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION \nCT C-spine negative. CT head shows a right frontal subacute\ninfarct. CT chest shows anterior fifth rib fractures\nbilaterally. There was also some supraclavicular stranding along\nthe left side , without any evidence of vessel injury. CT of the\nabdomen and pelvis is negative , except for a ruptured renal cyst.\nHe was also incidentally noted to show diverticulosis , without\nany diverticulitis. The CT of the thoracic and lumbar spines\nalso demonstrated no fractures , although there were incidentally\nnoted to be anterior osteophytes in numerous levels. CT of the\nchest demonstrated the rib fractures , but was otherwise negative.\nLaboratory , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate\n25 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 185 , and anion gap is 10 , AST\nand ALT are 20 and 25 respectively.

Urinalysis was negative.\nReview of the prehospital EKG demonstrated a complete\n( third-degree ) heart block. However , EKG done immediately upon\nadmission to the Manord Lost Community Hospital demonstrated a bifascicular block ,\nwith a rate in the 40s.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS-14": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS \n1. Cardiovascular: He was admitted to the Cardiac Step-Down\nUnit. He had Zoll pacer pads were placed upon his chest , and\natropine remained at his bedside. He also had an additional Zoll\npacer pads , as well as the pacemaker standby at the bedside ,\nhowever , these were not needed , as he has completed asymptomatic\nwith his bifascicular block. He had serial enzymes , which were\nperformed , he was ruled out for myocardial infarction. He went\nto the Cardiac Cath Lab , which demonstrated some coronary artery\ndisease. Please see the dictated cardiology reports for the\nfindings of the Cath Lab. It was felt , however , this was\nunchanged from prior studies. He also went to the\nElectrophysiology Lab. They were unable to induce any\nventricular tachycardia or other dysrhythmias during the\nprolonged EP studies. He had a pacemaker inserted. The\npacemaker was followed by the Electrophysiology Service , and was\nfound to be working adequately. The attending was Dr. Ahmed Lerwick , with the Electrophysiology Service. Dr. Arato with the\nCardiology Service saw him and was attending on record.\n2. Neurology: He was seen by the Neurology Service. So , this\nwas under Dr. Gaston Mcvenes , the attending neurologisT on the\ncase. He had an MRI/MRA performed of his head and neck. The\ndiffusion-weighted images demonstrated no evidence of any\nabnormality. There was a region of increase signal intensity on\nthe T2 and FLAIR images , involving the vasoganglion , extending\nthe corona radiata. Therefore , given the fact that signal was\nseen on the T2 and FLAIR , not on the diffusion-weighted , it was\nfelt that this was at least 10 days old. Therefore , this was not\nfelt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehicle\ncollision. It was most likely represented an old CVA , which was\nnot previously detected. Given the fact that the patient\nremained asymptomatic , and had a normal neurological exam , and\nradiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10\ndays old , and this was not further addressed. An MRA of his head\nand neck demonstrated tortuous vertebrobasilar system. The\nMRI/MRA of the neck was essentially normal , however , the left\nbifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis.\nThe right bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis ,\nhowever , could not be completed excluded. Given artifact , this\ncould be further followed up with an outpatient venous duplex of\nthe carotid arteries.\n3. Musculoskeletal: He was seen by the Orthopedic Service in\nthe Emergency Department at the time of the trauma , he ultimately\nhad an MRI that was performed of his knee. This showed tears of\nthe medial and lateral menisci. There was no evidence of\nfracture. He remained in a knee immobilizer. He saw Physical\nTherapy , which felt that further therapy would be indicated.\nWith the impression of the Orthopedic Service that no acute\nintervention was needed , and that he should follow-up with Sports\nMedicine or Orthopedics in approximately 3-4 weeks. In addition ,\nhe was noted to have several rib fractures. The rib fractures\nwere felt to be the source of his pain , he continue to complain\nof some inspiratory pain throughout his chest. However , he\nadamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall upon\ninspiring. It was therefore felt that given the negative enzymes\nand the negative Cath , and the known rib fractures that the chest\npain was strictly a result of a musculoskeletal pain. This pain\nwas well controlled with the combination of Dilaudid and\noxycodone. He was encouraged to take several deep breaths per\nhour to reduce the risk of atelectasis or pneumonia.\n4. Infectious Disease: There was no evidence of any acute\ninfection. Of note , his white count was trending upwards , on the\nlast two days of admission. It was felt that this probably\nrepresented stress , given all the recent procedures that were\ndone , including the catheterization and the electrophysiology\nstudies , rather than A2 infection. The chest x-ray was performed\non the 18 of April , which demonstrated no infiltrate. This was reviewed\nwith an attending radiologist who reported low lung volumes.\nOtherwise , it was essentially negative. In addition , a repeat\nurinalysis was performed. The results are pending at the time of\ndictation , however , will be followed up prior to the patient's\ndischarge from the hospital. The patient appears well , and\nstates that he is feeling at his best since the accident.\nHowever , further workup for his white count is not performed at\nthe present time , however , the patient is informed , as the Rehab\nHospital and the discharge summary , which show that the patient\nseem to develop any evidence of infection that he should be\nreevaluated by a physician.\n5. Nutrition: The patient is able to eat without any\ndifficulty. He was eating regular house diabetic/cardiac diet.\n6. Hypercholesterolemia: He was continued on his Zocor\nthroughout the hospitalization.\n7. Prophylaxis: He was initially treated with Lovenox 40 mg\nsub-Q. q. day for a prophylaxis against DVTs. He is also on\naspirin and Plavix for secondary cardiac and neurological\nprophylaxis. The Lovenox is discontinued , at the request of the\nElectrophysiology Service on the 5 of March\n8. Endocrine: Given the numerous contrast studies , initially\nhis metformin was held. However , he was later restarted on this.\nIn addition , he was continued on his glyburide and covered with\nsliding scale insulin. His blood sugar was never any significant\nproblem during his hospitalization.\n9. Disposition: The patient will be going to Rehab Facility , in\nstable condition. At the Rehab , he will continue to get physical\ntherapy , which he has received in the hospital. It was felt that\na short course of rehab would benefit the patient to allow him to\ngo back living independently again. He will be discharged to the\nRehab in stable condition.",

        "ADDENDUM-16": "ADDENDUM \nMr. Kostal had this pacemaker placed and was recovering\nuneventfully. However , it was noted that he started having\nincreasing white count. It was felt this was perhaps due to a\nmild urine infection and was started on Levaquin. However , he\nstarted the next day complaining increasing pain in his knee. At\nthis time , his white count had risen to 23 , 000. The knee was\nobviously a concern for possible infection. His knee was warm ,\nwas tender and was erythematous , compared to the contralateral\nside. As a result , the Orthopedic Service was again consulted.\nAn arthrocentesis was performed on his left knee , this was a dry\ntap; no fluid was able to be obtained. The subsequent day , he\nwas complaining of increasing pain , and the sed rate returned in\nthe 99 with a CRP of 190. The EP Service again evaluated the\npatient , and felt that there was no evidence of any clear\ninfection from the pacer site. He continued to have no erythema\nor tenderness around the pacer site. His chest x-ray was\nessentially unremarkable. The next day ( 5/1/05 ) , he was seen\nby the Rheumatology Service , under Dr. Broad who also felt this\nwas most likely to be prepatellar bursitis , probably septic in\nnature , with a hematoma. He was asked to seen by the Infectious\nDisease Service , under Dr. Mirick and Rich Rytuba\nHe was started on Ancef 1 gm q.8h. A PICC line will be placed\nlater today on the 2/22/05 and he will be discharged to rehab.\nOf note , he has been afebrile for more than 48 hours while on the\nAncef , and his white count has improved dramatically , into the\napproximately 10000 range. He will continue to get IV Ancef\nq.8h. for an additional 12 days.

She\nwas empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime with\nwet-to-dry dressings applied to her right foot wound. The\npatient was also continued on her prior dose of Macrobid for\npreviously-diagnosed UTI with her antibiotic regimen to be\ndiscontinued for this purpose on 1/0/2004 .  An angiogram\nperformed on hospital day #2 , revealed a right external iliac\nocclusion which was stented near the bifurcation of the internal\nand external iliac vessels. A distal stenosis of the external\niliac was opened with balloon angioplasty to good effect. The\npatient sustained a mild groin hematoma on the left at the access\nsite but had no change in her pulse exam there afterwards.\nFollowing her angiogram and percutaneous intervention , the\npatient was noted to demonstrate excellent right lower extremity\nDP and PT pulses which remained palpable through the duration of\nher hospital course. On hospital day #3 , the patient was brought\nto the operating room for debridement of her right foot. For a\ndetailed description of the patient's operative procedure , please\nthe relevant operative note. Patient tolerated the procedure\nwell and during the procedure , the patient's ulcer base was found\nto be contiguous with the first metatarsal head periosteum , and\ntherefore , a metatarsal head excision was performed. The\npatient's great toe was left in place with moderate debridement\nof the deep tissues. The ulcers on the lateral right foot were\nnot debrided at this time. Following her procedure , the patient\nwas empirically continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime. Her\noperative cultures subsequently grew out coagulase-negative staph\nwhich was sensitive to both Keflex and vancomycin. At this\npoint , the patient was switched to vancomycin therapy only and\nwas continued on VAC therapy through postoperative day #3. At\nthis point , the patient's VAC dressing was changed to demonstrate\na well-vascularized actively bleeding wound with granulation\ntissue and no signs of wound necrosis. The patient remained in\nstable condition through postoperative day #7 at which point , she\nwas returned to the operating room for a great toe amputation and\ndefinitive closure of her right foot wound. For a detailed\ndescription of this operative procedure , please see the relevant\noperative note. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was\nsubsequently returned to the Regular Outpatient Floor where she\nremained for the duration of her stay. A general overview of the\npatient's hospital course by system is as follows:\n1. Neurological: The patient demonstrated significant issues\nwith pain control for the duration of her stay. A fair amount of\nher pain was determined to be secondary to her right foot ulcer;\nhowever , the patient was also noted to have significant pain\nassociated with her contracted right lower extremity. For a\ntime , the patient was placed in a right lower extremity extension\nbrace which provided some measure of relief; however , upon\nregular examination of her right lower extremity , it was noted\nthat she was gradually developing pressure ulcers secondary to\nthe extension brace. A Neurology and Pain Service consultation\nwas obtained and the patient was subsequently recommended for\nZanaflex therapy which subsequently improved her pain control\ndramatically. The patient otherwise remained intact from a\nneurological perspective for the duration of her stay ,\ndemonstrating frequent emotional ability consistent with her\nbaseline examination.\n2. Cardiovascular: The patient remained stable from a\ncardiovascular perspective for the duration of her stay with no\nevidence of acute hemodynamic instability or compromise. At no\npoint did she demonstrate evidence of acute myocardial ischemia\nor infarction.\n3. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary\nperspective for the duration of her stay with no evidence of\nacute respiratory decompensation.\n4. GI: The patient remained stable from a gastrointestinal\nstandpoint for the duration of her stay and was noted to be\ntolerant of both solid and liquid oral intake. Upon discharge ,\nshe was noted to be tolerant of both solid and liquid p.o. intake\nand was noted to be independently productive of adequate amounts\nof stool and flatus.\n5. GU: As described previously , the patient was admitted with a\nknown diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. She was continued\non Macrobid therapy through 1/0/2004 , at which point this\ntherapy was discontinued. Subsequent follow-up urinalyses\ndemonstrated no further evidence of urinary tract infection.\nUpon completion of her Macrobid antibiotic course , the patient's\nFoley catheter was removed and she was noted to be independently\nproductive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of her\nstay. She at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renal\ncompromise or electrolyte imbalance.\n6. Heme: The patient remained stable with a stable hematocrit\nfor the duration of her stay. She was started on Plavix therapy\nfollowing her angiogram , on which she remains at the time of her\ndischarge. DVT prophylaxis was provided via subcutaneous heparin\nfor the duration of her stay.\n7. ID: As stated above , the patient's operative cultures were\nnoted to grow coag.-negative staph , sensitive to both vancomycin\nand Keflex. For the majority of her stay , the patient remained\non vancomycin therapy but was transitioned to Keflex on\n2/23/2004 , on which she remained for the duration of her stay.\nAt the time of discharge , the patient has been instructed to\ncomplete an additional 10-day course of Keflex therapy. Of note ,\nthe patient remained afebrile with a stable white count for the\nduration of her stay and her wound exam demonstrated no evidence\nof further infection at the ulcer site.\n8. Endocrine: The patient maintained adequately well-controlled\nblood sugars for the duration of her stay with no evidence of\nacute endocrinological compromise. The patient was subsequently\ncleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on\npostoperative days 10 and 3 , 9/19/2004 , with instructions for\nfollow up.",

The\npatient was transferred to Tampnew Hospital where a\ncardiac catheterization was performed which showed an 80% proximal\nLAD lesion and a 30% mid RCA lesion. The patient was then\ntransferred to Rocke Elel Word Hospital for PTCA. The angioplasty\nprocedure was not done. The patient was managed medically and did\nwell for the next seven years from a cardiac standpoint. She had\nonly minimal anginal symptoms and shortness of breath during that\nperiod. In May of 1988 , the patient had an echocardiogram\nwhich showed significant LVH , decreased LV compliance , borderline\nleft atrial enlargement and no regional wall motion abnormalities.\nIn March of 1991 , the patient had an ETT in which she exercised for\nfour minutes , 28 seconds achieving a peak heart rate of 103 and a\npeak blood pressure of 150/60 , stopping secondary to fatigue and\nshortness of breath without chest pain or EKG changes. Also in\nMarch of 1991 , the patient had pulmonary function tests which\nshowed normal spirometry and lung volumes. On 0/28/91 , the patient\nwas having progressive shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion\nthat morning. She presented to Li General Hospital with worsening\ndyspnea , wheezing. Her respiratory rate was 30 , and O2 saturation\nwas 85%. The patient was treated for presumed asthma with\nBronkosol nebulizers and Solu-Medrol. During the second Bronkosol\ntreatment , the patient developed 2/10 substernal chest pressure\nradiating to the left arm which was relieved completely with one\nsublingual nitroglycerin. There were no EKG changes. The patient\nwas transferred to West Hospital where she underwent\na V-Q scan , the results of which showed low probability of\npulmonary embolus. O2 saturation was 95%. The patient was sent\nhome on Ventolin inhaler. The patient stayed at home for the next\nthree weeks , symptom-free. On 8/11 , the patient while walking at\nthe Jose Xingsterka Sno became acutely short of breath with 2/10\nsubsternal chest pressure radiating to the right arm without\nnausea , vomiting or diaphoresis or lightheadedness. The chest\npressure and shortness of breath decreased with rest. The patient\nthen presented to the Adin Hospital and was then transferred to\nDutchessa Hospital . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary\nartery disease , status post myocardial infarction as above.\nHypertension. Type II hyperlipidemia. Sjorgren's syndrome.\nHistory of deep venous thromboses in 1981.

Chest x-ray showed a question infiltrate in the left base\nconsistent with atelectasis.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-10": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted to the Tu Hospital Emergency\nRoom where she was tachypneic and wheezing with a\npO2 of 86%. EKG showed only T wave flattening in I and L. The\npatient was admitted for presumed asthma and bronchitis and treated\nwith Bronkosol nebulizers. In the setting of the Bronkosol , the\npatient had substernal chest pressure radiating to the left arm.\nEKG showed 1 mm of ST depression in I and L and 1 mm ST elevation\nin lead III. The pain resolved with three sublingual\nnitroglycerin. The pain recurred a few minutes later and was again\nresolved with Nitropaste and IV Lopressor. The patient ruled out\nfor myocardial infarction with CPK's of 43 , 36 , 37. The patient\nwas then transferred to the Medical Service and was managed with\ndiltiazem , Lopressor , Isordil and aspirin. On hospital day number\ntwo , the patient went for echocardiogram which was not obtained\nbecause the patient had developed 5/10 substernal chest pressure\nwhich resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. There were no\nEKG changes , the patient was started on heparin with question of\nunstable angina at that time. On hospital day number three , the\npatient went for cardiac catheterization which showed serial 40 and\n50% lesions in the LAD and also an 80% lesion in the distal RCA.\nThere were no complications post catheterization. It was\nquestionable whether these lesions were serious enough to account\nfor the patient's symptoms. The patient's medical regimen was\nadvanced and she has tolerated that well and has been symptom free\nfor the past 48 hours. She was discharged home in stable\ncondition. She will follow-up with Dr. Gagne in one week. The\npatient also had asymptomatic pyuria and bacteruria and was treated\nfor a presumed urinary tract infection with three days of oral\nBactrim.",

He was admitted to the Cardiology\nService for cardiac catheterization. His history began in l976\nwhen he presented with substernal chest pain and shortness of\nbreath. In l98l , he experienced an anterior myocardial infarction\nand in March of l98l , underwent a three-vessel coronary artery\nbypass graft with mitral valve replacement. He did fairly well\nwith no recurrent symptoms until July of l989 when he presented\nwith congestive heart failure and ruled out for myocardial\ninfarction. A thallium exercise treadmill test revealed\ninferoapical ischemia and the patient was continued with medical\ntherapy. He did well until one to two weeks prior to admission\nwhen he developed chest pain which radiated to the left arm and was\npersistent for three hours after which time it was treated with\nNitroglycerin at Re Lalakety Wood,rank Hospital and resolved. An exercise\ntreadmill test was stopped secondary to shortness of breath and\nthallium scan revealed inferoapical scarring and septal apical\nreperfusion abnormality. The patient subsequently underwent\ncardiac catheterization at Dentan Lascrople which\nrevealed l00% occlusion of his left anterior descending graft and\npatent posterior descending artry graft and OM2 graft. His native\nvessels were remarkable for significant disease throughout his left\nanterior descending , an l00% circumflex lesion at the obtuse\nmarginal l , l00% proximal obtuse marginal lesion , and l00% right\ncoronary artery occlusion. Left ventriculogram revealed an\nejection fraction of 0.6 with apical hypokinesis. The patient was\nreferred to Cardiac Surgery Service for evaluation and coronary\nartery bypass grafting was elected.

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-3": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 54-year-old black\nwoman who is status post coronary\nartery bypass grafting approximately two years ago by Dr. Micciche\nwho had developed recurrent substernal chest pain approximately\nfour months after her bypass surgery. The patient underwent\nexercise treadmill testing which showed non-diagnostic ST segment\nchanges. However , thallium studies revealed decreased perfusion to\nthe apex , superior portion of the septum as well as the\nanterolateral wall. There was reperfusion of the high septal and\nanterolateral wall. The patient then proceeded to cardiac\ncatheterization which revealed 100% stenosis of her previous graft.\nAdditionally there was 100% mid stenosis of the right coronary\nartery , 80% stenosis of the left anterior descending , 90% mid\nstenosis of the first diagonal , and 100% stenosis of the circumflex\nafter the first obtuse marginal. There was anterior hypokinesis as\nwell as apical and inferior akinesis. There was severely decreased\nleft ventricular function. The pulmonary pressures were fairly\nunremarkable. Thus , the patient presented for reop coronary artery\nbypass grafting.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-4": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was taken to the Operating Room on\n13 of July .  Under general endotracheal anesthesia\ncoronary artery bypass grafting times three was performed. The\nright internal mammary artery was grafted to the first diagonal as\nwell as saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending , the\nold obtuse marginal graft , and the second diagonal. The patient\nwas found to have dense cardiac adhesions. Her old right coronary\nartery graft was occluded and the old obtuse marginal graft was\ntightly stenotic at the origin. The left internal mammary artery\nwas subtotally occluded distally. The patient spontaneously\ndefibrillated and demonstrated modestly decreased left ventricular\nfunction. The patient was taken to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit\nin stable rhythm with stable vital signs. Postoperatively the\npatient's course was thoroughly unremarkable. The patient required\nsodium Nitroprusside in the immediate postoperative period. There\nwas no evidence of postoperative myocardial infarction. The\npatient was successfully extubated on the second postoperative day\nand her mediastinal and pleural tubes were also pulled without\nsignificant incident. The patient's diuresis was initiated and\ntolerated well. The rest of the patient's postoperative course was\nunremarkable. She remained in normal sinus rhythm without any\nevidence of arrhythmia. She was essentially afebrile and her\nwounds were all healing well. However , on chest x-ray it was\ndemonstrated that the patient had right lower lobe collapse.\nBecause of her afebrile state and good oxygenation on room air the\npatient was not bronch'd in order to re-expand her right lower\nlobe. At the time of dictation , one day prior to proposed\ndischarge the patient's chest x-ray showed some improved aeration\nof that lower lobe. Thus , the patient will likely be discharged on\n29 of March . ",

A left\nlower extremity ultrasound obtained at that time revealed a fluid\ncollection along the prior SVG tract , corresponding to the area with\nthe most significant erythema. Mr. Tixier was continued on\nvancomycin and levofloxacin and was taken back to the operating\nroom on 10/28/06 for drainage and irrigation of left lower extremity\nendoscopic saphenous vein harvest site. No obvious purulence was noted\nin the operating room. Cultures were sent from the OR which\nsubsequently revealed no growth. Postoperatively , the wound was\npacked with wet-to-dry dressing , changed daily , and the patient\nwas continued on vancomycin IV antibiotics with white blood cell\ncount improving. Following operative reintervention , SVG harvest\nsite incision appeared less inflamed , less tender and less erythematous ,\nwith corresponding improvement in cellulitis. A plan had been made to\nsubsequently discharge the patient on postoperative day #13 , 7/8/06.\nA long line was placed at this time in anticipation of discharge for\ncontinuation of seven days of IV vancomycin. However , white blood\ncount rose to 19.4 on planned day of discharge , 1/22/06 , and ,\nalthought the patient remained afebrile and the wound continued to\nremain clean with minimal cellulitis , Mr. Obanion was kept inpatient\novernight for continued observation and re-assessment of WBC. On\n8/1/06 , white blood cell count improved to 14.3 , the patient\nremained afebrile , and the wound continued to remain clean with\npacking changed wet-to-dry daily. Additional sources of leukocytosis\nwere sought including sputum culture , which subsequently demonstrated\nno significant growth. Urinalysis was noted to be mildly dirty , for\nwhich the patient began a short course of p.o. levofloxacin.\nSternal wound continued to remain intact with no sternal click ,\nerythema , or drainage noted.

He was found to have critical\ncoronary artery disease and was referred to the Cardiac Surgery\nService. The patient underwent a completion of a preoperative\nworkup and on 11/2/07 went to the operating room where Dr.\nWink performed a CABG x5. The LIMA was used to bypass the LAD ,\nthe left radial artery was used to bypass the ramus , and\nsaphenous vein was used to bypass the OM1 , PDA and LVB1. The\ncardiopulmonary bypass time was 145 minutes and the aortic\ncross-clamp time was 116 minutes. The patient tolerated the\nprocedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery\nIntensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. On\npostoperative day #1 , the patient was extubated. He complained of\nright hand weakness and numbness but was otherwise recovering\nvery well. The Neurology Service was consulted and they suggested\nthat the right hand symptoms were from surgical manipulation of\nthe chest or positioning of the arm intraoperatively.\nOccupational therapy and physical therapy were consulted to treat\nthe patient's right hand weakness and numbness. Otherwise , the\npatient was progressing very well. He was started on Lopressor\nto prevent atrial fibrillation and diltiazem for his radial\nartery bypass graft. He was off all hemodynamic drips and was in\na stable rhythm with a stable blood pressure. The patient's diet\nwas advanced as tolerated and he was producing good urine output.\nThe patient was followed very closely throughout the\npostoperative period by the Diabetes Management Service for high\nglucose levels. On postoperative day #2 , the patient's pacer\nwires and chest tubes were removed without complication. He was\nambulating and showed good postoperative progress. On\npostoperative days 3 and 4 , the patient continued diuresis for\npostoperative fluid retention. The patient's white blood cell\ncount was noted to be 13.7 and a urinalysis and urine culture\nwere sent. The urine culture grew greater than 100 , 000 colony\nforming units of gram-negative rods and he was started on\nciprofloxacin for five-day course for postoperative urinary tract\ninfection. Otherwise , by postoperative #5 the patient had\nprogressed extremely well. He was ambulating in the halls. He\nhad moved his bowels and had no difficulties with urination.\nHe had no complaints of pain. He had remained in a sinus rhythm\nwith a stable blood pressure and was oxygenating well on room\nair. The patient was ready for discharge home. The Diabetes\nManagement Service met with the patient to discuss taking insulin\nat home for his poor glucose control. He agreed to take Lantus\nat night and follow up with his primary care physician for future\nmanagement of his diabetes mellitus. On the morning of discharge\nhome , the patient's vital signs were temperature 97.7 degrees ,\nheart rate 86 in the sinus rhythm , blood pressure 110/70 ,\nrespiratory rate 20 and O2 saturation 95% on room air.

A head CT was performed on hospital day number one but was\nnegative with no evidence of cerebral infarct or bleeding.\nHowever , a follow up head CT on hospital day number three\ndemonstrated acute infarct in the left insular capsule and left\ncorona radiata. A carotid ultrasound was obtained on hospital day\nnumber five which demonstrated bilateral carotid plaques with less\nthan 50 percent stenosis of both carotid arteries. Because of the\npatient's history of diabetes and his cardiac history , especially\ngiven his prior myocardial infarction , the patient was placed on a\nROMI protocol. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction\nand he was given a cardiac echocardiogram on hospital day number\ntwo. The echocardiogram demonstrated increased left ventricular\nsize with preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of\n65 percent. He had dilated left and right atria and he had\nthickened mitral valve leaflets with 4+ mitral regurgitation , with\nflow reversible into his pulmonary veins. He also had 3 to 4+\ntricuspid regurgitation with slow reversal into the vena cava. He\nhad a trileaflet aortic valve with mild sclerosis but no\ninsufficiency or stenosis. He also had increased right heart size\nwith right heart pressures of 55 to 60 mm of mercury. He was noted\nto have a trivial pericardial effusion. Of note , there was no\nevidence of any thrombus in the heart. However , because of the\nnature of his stroke , which was felt to be embolic by neurology , as\nwell as his enlarged atria. The patient was placed on IV Heparin\nand he was then started on oral Coumadin for long-term\nanticoagulation. The patient did very well after his stroke and\nhis original slurred speech improved markedly over the course of\nhis admission. He also regained full strength in his right arm ,\nalthough he continued to have some decreased coordination in that\narm. The patient also demonstrated inability to swallow without\ndifficulty and an esophagogram with video analysis was performed on\nhospital day number six , prior to his discharge. The video study\nof his swallowing demonstrated that he had essentially normal\nswallowing and he was cleared to go home on a regular diet. Of\nnote , his blood pressure tended to be low , around 100 to 110\nsystolic , while in the hospital , so his Lisinopril was discontinued\nand he was given instructions that Lisinopril would be restarted by\nhis CMC attending after his discharge. His hydroxyurea was\nincreased from 500 mg to 1 gram q day. The patient did quite well\nafter his stroke and he was discharged home with services on\nMay , 1995.",

She was tolerating the\nchemotherapy without complications until developing symptoms of\nfatigue as well as shortness of breath over a three to four day\nperiod prior to admission. In August 1997 , Ms. Vanzile presented to\nthe Oncology Clinic with a biliary obstruction that was shown to be\na peripancreatic mass and a left subclavicular lymph node. Biopsy\nof the subclavicular lymph node revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ,\nfor which she was treated with CHOP chemotherapy. Given her\nprevious exposure to Adriamycin for treatment of Hodgkin's disease\nten years previously , the patient's cardiac function was followed\nand serial echocardiograms over the past six months. The previous\nthree cycles of CHOP chemotherapy were complicated with a\nperipancreatic abscess which was treated with intravenous then oral\nantibiotics with good resolution. She , subsequently , three more\ncycles of CHOP chemotherapy and was in near complete remission by\ngallium scan; however , a persistent abdominal mass was still\ndetected on Computerized Tomography scan. Her therapy was stopped\nafter five cycle of CHOP due to the maximum Adriamycin dose of 460\nmg/m2. The patient was being restaged and was found to develop\nacute shortness of breath over the weekend , denying any chest pain ,\nnausea or vomiting , or light-headedness. The patient denies any\nchanges in her activities except for becoming more tired with\nexertion and wakening up suddenly the night prior to admission\nfeeling short of breath.",
        "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY-5": "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  Includes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , Hodgkin's\ndisease , hypertension , and a total abdominal\nhysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.",

Her vital signs were a heart\nrate of 140; respiration rate of 32 to 36. Oxygen saturation of\n92% on room air and is afebrile. The neck examination revealed a\njugular venous pressure of 8 centimeters. No thyromegaly or\nlymphadenopathy was appreciated. Chest examination revealed\nbilateral lower lobe rales , no rhonchi or wheezes were appreciated.\nCoronary examination revealed tachycardic rate and rhythm with a\npositive S3.

There was a normal differential of the complete blood\ncount. Her coags are also within normal parameters. The\nurinalysis was benign.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-9": "HOSPITAL COURSE  Problem number one is the patient's shortness of\nbreath. Given the acute onset of shortness of\nbreath and dyspnea upon exertion , causes contributing to the change\nin pulmonary status included pulmonary embolism , congestive heart\nfailure , and pneumonia. Of note , the patient's chest x-ray\nrevealed bilateral pleural effusions. However , the patient was\nafebrile. Therefore , our suspicion for pneumonia was low. The\npatient received an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function.\nThe echocardiogram on November , 1997 , revealed a mildly enlarged\nventricle with moderately decreased systolic function. Estimated\nejection fraction was 30%. Global hypokinesis was identified along\nwith a marked significant involvement of the apex as well as the\nanterior septal and inferior regions of the heart. Normal right\nventricular systolic function was observed. Also noted is that\nthere was a small pericardial effusion with an elevated PA pressure\nof 36. There was also the existence of mild to moderate mitral\nregurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation. All of this had\nlittle change from the echocardiogram taken on March , 1997 ,\nwhich revealed an ejection fraction of 30% to 35% along with\nhypokinesis and a small pericardial effusion. This was markedly\ndifferent from the patient's echocardiogram in March 1997 with\nrevealed an ejection fraction of 67% with normal left ventricular\nfunction and no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was started\non a Lasix regimen in order to start diuresis with good response to\nintravenous Lasix. The patient also was less dependent on oxygen\nsupplements , however , the patient still reported episodes of\ndyspnea upon minor activity. A cardiology consultation was\nobtained to evaluate the deterioration in the patient's cardiac\nfunction. This deterioration was associated with the toxicity of\nAdriamycin. A repeat echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate the\npericardial effusion as well as an abnormality identified on the\nMarch , 1997 , echocardiogram consistent with a possible rupture\nof one of the chordae tendineae. There was little difference\nbetween the echocardiogram from March , 1997 , November , 1997 ,\nand February , 1997. The patient was maintained on a regimen of\nLasix as well as Ace inhibitors. Initially , the addition of\nionatrope was considered. However , given the patient's history of\npotassium and magnesium wasting , it was decided to add digoxin to\nthe patient's medical regimen.\nThe patient was also evaluated for the possibility of developing a\npulmonary embolus. Lower extremity noninvasive examinations\nrevealed patent vasculature , but no indication of a lower extremity\ndeep venous thrombosis. The patient also received a VQ scan which\nrevealed a low probability of the presence of a pulmonary embolus.\nAfter the obtaining of a VQ scan which was negative , the heparin\nthat was initially stated upon admission of the patient , was\nstopped.\nThe patient was discharged on a regimen of enalapril as well as\nLasix in order to manage the congestive heart failure. The\netiology of the congestive heart failure was thought to the\nAdriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.\nFluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient has a history of\na potassium and magnesium wasting. Serial profile-7s were obtained\nand potassium and magnesium were regularly supplemented. The\npatient was discharged with a daily regimen of potassium.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-5": "HOSPITAL COURSE  Patient was admitted for a rule out myocardial\ninfarction for the substernal chest pain although\nthere was a low index of suspicion for heart attack. She ruled out\nby CK and had no EKG changes. PHC Cardiology felt that this chest\npain was not related to her heart or ischemic cause and left it up\nto the primary provider , Dr. Dorset , to arrange for an out-patient\nexercise stress test if felt necessary. Most likely , the chest\npain represented some type of gastroesophageal reflux disease and\nthe patient was restarted on Axid. Another issue was question of\nnew neurologic deficits although the original head CT showed no\nevidence of stroke. The stroke may have been too early to detect\nleaving diagnosis of either a new cerebrovascular accident , a\nmanifestation of a seizure , or a conversion reaction secondary to\nher borderline personality. Her primary deficit remained the\nslowing of speech without actual slurring of speech and without any\ndeficits in understanding or expression. A lumbar puncture was\ndone on the second day of hospitalization with a mildly elevated\nprotein in the sixties and a glucose in the 120 range. Cell count\nwas low not consistent with infection. A cardiac echo was also\ndone which showed normal left ventricular function without any\nsegmantal wall motion abnormalities , there was a question of left\nventricular hypertrophy , and carotid dopplers were done which\nshowed no significant disease in the internal carotid arteries ,\nhowever , there was a mild left internal carotid artery plaque.\nPatient's neurologic status remained stable during her\nhospitalization. She was started on Aspirin on admission. After\nmuch discussion with NMH Neurology as well as with Dr. Talboti , it\nwas felt that the patient could be followed as an out-patient. It\nis recommended that the patient have Neurology follow-up next week ,\nhad a repeat CT of the head done to see whether ther is a new\ninfarct , and also an EEG was recommended by the Neurology\nConsultation Servicer here for a question of seizures. Patient\nwill have home Occupational , Physical , and Speech Therapy provided\nthrough Dishmution .  Another issue was hypercalcemia. Patient had an\nelevated calcium on admission. Patient was guaiac negative without\nany mass lesions. Patient's chest X-Ray was also read as clear\nwithout any masses. Patient did have a cursory breast examination\nwithout any evidence of a breast mass and has had mammograms in the\npast without any evidence of malignancy. The etiology of the\nelevated calcium was unclear although leading diagnoses include\nprimary hyperparathyroidism , prolonged immobilization , or lying in\nbed with some leeching of calcium versus a possible malignancy.\nPatient should have her calcium followed as an out-patient. She\ndid have a PTH level drawn during this admission , the results were\nnot back at the time of discharge , however , this level should be\nchecked upon her next visit. Patient is now ready for discharge\nhome.",

This hospital course will be\nsummarized briefly by dates.\n1. On 4/13/03 , the patient was found to have progression of his\nright lower extremity infection and was taken to the OR for\ndebridement.\n2. On 2/19/03 , Diuril was added to his regimen and his\ncreatinine was noted to increase from 2.6 to 3.6 and diuretics\nwere subsequently held.\n3. On 11/30/03 , the patient retuned to the OR for revision of\nright wound infection and underwent a further transmetatarsal\namputation.\n4. On 4/12/03 , the patient noted nausea , fatigue , and malaise\ncoincident with 20-beat run of VT followed by syncope in the\nstetting of dobutamine. The VT terminated spontaneously. The\npatient was loaded on amiodarone , unfortunately still required\nlow dose dobutamine to maintain his cardiac output.\n5. On 3/15/03 , the patient returned to the OR for debridement\nand was noted to be hypotensive with baseline systolic blood\npressures of 80s going to 60s over palp with decrease urine\noutput. He was transferred to the CCU briefly and did well on\nionotropes and diuretics. He was transferred back to the floor\nand continued to have decrease urine output on maximal diuretic\ndoses and ionotropes.\n6. On 6/8/03 , the renal surgery recommended that the dobutamine\nbe stopped in order to enhance renal perfusion and Lasix be\nincreased to 80 mg per hour. The patient promptly developed\ncardiogenic shock with discontinuation of dobutamine and was\nagain transferred to the CCU with systolic blood pressures in the\n60s. He was ashen and cold. Subsequently , he has required\ndobutamine between 1 and 2.5 mcg/kg/minute to maintain his\ncardiac output as well as CVVH for volume management. He has\ntolerated the FL rates between 15 and 200.\n7. On 7/0/03 , the patient noted hoarseness. Otolaryngology\nevaluation demonstrated paralyzed left vocal cords thought to be\nsecondary to left atrial enlargement or potentially the placement\nof a left IJ catheter.\n8. On 2/11/03 , a tunneled catheter was placed for hemodialysis\nand CVVH access with plan initiation of hemodialysis.\n9. On 11/26/03 , he had first course of hemodialysis and he\ntolerated this procedure well. A PICC line was placed. The\npatient was given a pneumococcal vaccine.\n10. Cardiovascular:\na. Pump: The patient with advanced dilated cardiomyopathy with\npoor overall prognosis , was admitted for aggressive diuresis in\norder to improve his position on the ?? ?? curve. This was\nperformed by CVVH and is now being transitioned to hemodialysis.\nHe has beyond less invasive measures such as digoxin and ACE\ninhibitors , and he is now dobutamine dependent.\nb. Ischemia: The patient without any history of ischemic heart\ndisease and no symptoms suggestive of any incorporate lesions.\nc. Rhythm: Chronic AF and occasional ectopy and VT on\ndobutamine , currently loaded on amiodarone without any further\nevents.\n11. Infectious Disease: The patient with chronic osteomylitis ,\ncurrently in a six-week course of ceftazidime , vancomycin ,\nFlagyl , and Diflucan for complicated osteomyelitis , end date is\non 2/30/03. He was given pneumococcal vaccine. He is\nup-to-date on his flu vaccine.\n12. Renal: The patient has had progressive renal failure likely\nsecondary to low flow to the kidneys. This has been exacerbated\nby ACE inhibitors in the past. In addition , increasing doses of\ndiuretics have been ineffective that the patient is able to\nobtain increased amounts of cardiac output. As he comes on\nstrongly through , he may regain some renal function , however , it\nis predicted that he will require hemodialysis for remainder of\nthe life. He has tolerated this. A tunneled catheter was placed\nfor access on 9/2/03.\n13. Vascular: The patient with peripheral vascular disease now\nstatus post transmetatarsal amputation. He remains with a open\nwound in his left foot and a calf ulcer. The patient is planned\nto be evaluated by Plastic Surgery prior to discharge for final\nplans whether a flap or healing by secondary retention.\n14. Psychiatry: The patient is depressed with frequent periods\nof anxiety , exceedingly fearful of dying , and unable to sleep\nwith light off or with drapes pole secondary to believe that if\nhe falls asleep , he will no longer wake up. He was seen by\nPsychiatry , who suggested starting low dose of Zyprexa in the\nevening. This has greatly improved his mood and he is doing well\nfrom this regard.\n15. Endocrine: The patient failed a course of stimulation test\nand was started on hydrocortisone. When this was tapered down ,\nhe had some periods of hypotension and this was increased again.\nHe remains on maintenance doses of hydrocortisone. Etiology of\nhis adrenal insufficieny is unclear. Additionally , the patient\nhas diabetes. He was on oral hypoglycemic as an outpatient ,\nhowever , now this renal function , he has been transitioned over\nto insulin with his standing doses of Lantus with a lispro\nsliding scale.\n16. FEN: The patient was started on TPN for quite severe\nmalnutrition. He now has increasing albumin with increased\nappetite , and he is tolerating more food. He has been placed on\nnectar thick liquids for secondary to left vocal cord paralysis\nand visualized aspiration on barium swallow by ENT.",

        "NEURO-4": "NEURO  Neurology consult was obtained for increased somnolence\nover the past three weeks , which was noted per the patient's son\nwhich he thinks is a change from baseline. Neurology consult\nrecommended that we get an MRI/MRA of the brain with gadolinium\ncontrast to look for leptomeningeal disease and other sources for\nincreased somnolence which are treatable. They also recommended\nan EEG be done. The EEG was done and showed no seizure activity.\nThe MRI/MRA was done and showed only a right MCA infarct , which\nwas known and old with no interval change. Gadolinium contrast\nwas not given because the patient became too agitated and was\nmoving too much during the study for an effective study to be\nobtained. They also recommended that we check certain labs\nincluding folate , B12 , TSH and RPR all of which were essentially\nnormal. TSH was elevated but patient has a history of\nhypothyroidism and is on Synthroid. Neurology was consulted on\nthe day of discharge and they agreed that no further evaluation\nof the somnolence is necessary at this time. If the somnolence\ncontinues into the near future further evaluation may be\nnecessary. Leptomeningeal disease is unlikely given the lack of\nnew neurological findings , and since the patient is scheduled for\na PET scan of the chest to evaluate for spread of her known lung\ncancer , if there is no interval change in her oncological process\nthe likeliness of leptomeningeal disease is quite low.",

She was urinating on her own\nwithout a Foley catheter. Her blood sugars were stable. A\none-to-one sitter which had been placed prior during her hospital\ncourse was discontinued. Her ciprofloxacin course for her\nurinary tract infection was discontinued because she had been\ntreated fully and her Lopressor was changed to Toprol-XL the\nextended release formulation for improved compliance and\nconvenience.

She has no known diabetic retinopathy ,\nnephropathy or peripheral neuropathy. 3 ) The patient has a history\nof tuberculosis approximately 20 years ago , diagnosed from a lymph\nnode biopsy of the left neck. She was treated for one year with a\ncombination of medications. She currently experiences no night\nsweats , loss or weight , loss of appetite or hemoptysis. She does ,\nhowever , admit to a dry cough especially at night which has been\nincreasing over the last six months. Her BCG status is unknown.\nPast surgical history is remarkable for: 1 ) Status post cesarean\nsection times one. 2 ) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy ,\nright salpingo-oophorectomy for metromenorrhagia approximately\n1991. The patient currently denies any post or perimenopausal\nsymptoms. 3 ) Status post lymph node biopsy of the left neck\napproximately 20 years ago for tuberculosis.

She was admitted to Namen's General Hospital under the care of Dr. Devera in May of 1992 for\ncongestive heart failure which resolved with diuresis. Since then\nher baseline exercise tolerance is that she is unable to do a full\nload of laundry without getting tired , unable to climb a full\nflight of steps without getting tired , but does not experience\nchest pain. However , today while walking in her sister-in-law's\nhouse she experienced severe retrosternal chest pain radiating to\nher left shoulder and back , which is as great as 10 out of 10 for\nseverity and lasted for approximately one minute. It was associated\nwith dyspnea , sweating and nausea but no vomiting. She also\nexperienced some palpitations. Therefore , she had persistent chest\npressure and dyspnea on arrival at the Amar Portraim Hospital\nEmergency Room approximately 20 minutes later , at which time the\npressure and dyspnea were relieved with two sublingual nitrates.\nReview of systems is remarkable also for chronic cough increasing\nover the last five months , especially since her Capoten dose was\nincreased. She denies fever , chills , previous episodes of\npneumonia. Of note she was ruled out for active pulmonary\ntuberculosis during her admission in Soba Medical Center in July 1992.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-6": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  On examination on admission , she is a\npleasant , elderly woman. Her vital signs\nreveal a temperature of 97.4 orally , heart rate of 80 regular ,\nrespiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 108/80 supine with no\northostatic hypertension. O2 saturation was 99% on 4 liters. Head\nand neck examination were unremarkable with no evidence of\nadenopathy and a normal thyroid gland. Respiratory system showed\nscattered bibasilar crackles but no focal pathology. Cardiovascular\nsystem showed a heart rate of 80 which was regular at full volume\nwith occasional ectopic beats. There was no evidence of paradoxical\nalternates. Jugular venous pressure was elevated to 10 cm above\nthe angle of Louis' and had a prominent CV wave. All pulses were\npresent and equal. The cardiac apex was in the sixth left\nintercostal space. Midaxillary line was volume overloaded in\ncharacter. No thrills or rubs were appreciated , however , there was\ndullness to percussion beyond the apex and an S3 gallop was heard\nthroughout the precordium. The patient had a soft S1 , a III/VI\npansystolic murmur heard best at the apex and radiating through to\nthe left axilla. There was also I/VI MVM which could be brought on\nwith exercise and lying in the left lateral position. A PI murmur\nwas also heart similar in character to the MI murmur but heard best\non the left sternal border and radiating up the neck. There was\nalso an ejection systolic murmur at the left sternal border II/VI\nin intensity and radiating poorly increased with expiration.\nAbdominal examination was soft , nontender , nondistended. There was\na 12 cm hepar which was soft and nonpulsatile. No spring was\npalpable. No masses were appreciated. Bowel sounds were present ,\nand there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. A well healed\nsubumbilical midline scar was evident. Rectal examination showed\nno masses , guaiac negative brown stool. Bimanual examination was\ndeferred at this time. Central nervous system examination was\ngrossly intact. Extremities showed pulses to be present\nbilaterally and equal. There was no evidence of deep venous\nthrombosis and no pedal edema or sacral edema were appreciated.",
        "LABORATORY DATA-7": "LABORATORY DATA  Laboratory examinations on admission showed a\nsodium of 136 , potassium 3.4 , blood urea nitrogen\n16 , creatinine 0.8 , and a glucose of 136. White count was 8.2 with\na normal differential. Hematocrit was 41.2 and platelets 247. PT\nand PTT were 13.4 and 29.4 respectively. Digoxin level was 2.1.\nChest X ray showed significant cardiomegaly with dilatation of both\nleft and right ventricles but minimal congestive heart failure. The\nelectrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats per minute\nwith a complete left bundle branch block and no evidence of acute\nischemia. There was no change as compared with electrocardiograms\nfrom 1/28 .  The initial CPK was 44.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  In summary then the patient is a 54-year-old woman\nwith cardiomyopathy , noninsulin-dependent\ndiabetes , who presented now with an episode of chest pain and\ndyspnea for rule out myocardial infarction and further evaluation.\nActively she is in hospital where it as follows: 1 ) Cardiomegaly of\nunclear etiology: last echo done was in 11 of August by Dr. Pernin which\nshowed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global left and right\nventricular dilatation. 2 ) Chest pressure and substernal chest pain\nand dyspnea: The patient was placed on the telemetry floor , was\nmonitored for 24 hours and a rule out protocol was performed. The\nCK were 44 , 37 , and 34 respectively and there was no evidence of\nelectrocardiogram changes on serial electrocardiogram. She did have\none run of 4-beat ventricular tachycardia the first 24 hours of\nadmission. Potassium was replaced in view of the potassium level of\n3.4. Initial Digoxin level was 2.1 and Digoxin was held for a\nperiod of 72 hours. She was continued on her Lasix , Captopril and\na sliding scale Nitropaste and was started on one aspirin a day.\n3 ) Noninsulin-dependent diabetes was well controlled on diet and\nGlucotrol and her sugars remained between 100 and 200 throughout\nthis admission. 4 ) Status post tuberculosis: In view of her\nprevious tuberculosis status , a PPD was not performed and the\npatient was not ruled out for tuberculosis.\nOn review of Mrs. Ekis 's history and following a rule out for a\nrecent myocardial infarct , it became apparent that her exercise\ntolerance had diminished dramatically over the past three months\nand that she was already on optimal medications. It was thought\nthat she would benefit from a cardiac transplant evaluation at this\npoint and Dr. Gerathy was kind enough to consult. A transthoracic\nechocardiogram performed on 1 of February showed once again a dilated\ncardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. There was 2+ of\nmitral regurgitation with a pulmonary arterial pressure of\napproximately 60. There was also 3+ or PR and evidence of\nsignificant left atrial hypertrophy. No ventricular clicks or\nthrombosis were seen. However , in view of the dilated\ncardiomyopathy , the patient was started on Coumadin therapy. An ETT\nO2 uptake test was performed on 1 of February and the patient performed\nfor 3.38 minutes on a cycle ergometer. She experienced on chest\npain and there were no obvious electrocardiogram changes. The test\nwas stopped because of shortness of breath. Her O2 uptake was\ncalculated at 11.4 per kick per minute. In addition her Capoten\ntherapy was changed from 37.5 q.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. At this point\nit became apparent that Mrs. Stuesse had a significant degree of\ncardiac dysfunction. A right-sided catheterization performed on\n1 of January showed a right atrial pressure of 26 and a pulmonary wedge\npressure of 36. It was decided that she would be an excellent\ncandidate for cardiac transplantation , and a full cardiac\ntransplant workup was initiated. The following tests were sent off ,\nthe results of many of which are still pending: 1 ) One chest X ray\ndetailed above; 2 ) electrocardiogram as detailed; 3 ) urinalysis and\nsediment which are unremarkable; 4 ) SMA-7 with CPK , complete with\ndifferential , PT , PTT , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , reticulocyte\ncount and bleeding time; 5 ) HLA typing and antibody screen which\nare pending; 6 ) blood typing; 7 ) dental consult; 8 ) physiotherapy\nconsult; 9 ) Social Service consult; 10 ) nutrition consult; 11 )\nGynecology appointment made as an outpatient and a booking for\nbilateral mammography was made; 12 ) pulmonary function tests were\nperformed; 13 ) noninvasive carotid Doppler studies and peripheral\narterial noninvasive studies were performed the results of which\nare pending; 14 ) echocardiogram as detailed above; 15 ) exercise\ntest with O2 as detailed above; 16 ) 24-hour urine for creatinine\nand protein; 17 ) HIV antibody test; 18 ) fasting glucose serum\nprotein , electrophoresis , cholesterol , triglycerides ,\nimmunoglobulins , hepatitis B and C serology , as well as blood\ncultures , sputum cultures and urine cultures were sent; 19 )\npsychiatric consults , has not been obtained at this point and will\nbe done as an outpatient; 20 ) virology titers for cytomegalovirus ,\nEbstein-Barr virus , toxoid , measles and varicella zoster were sent;\n21 ) TFT and hemoglobin A1C were sent; and 22 ) right heart\ncatheterization as detailed above; 23 ) abdominal ultrasound to rule\nout gallstones , aortic aneurysm and renal abnormalities were done\nand were within normal limits.",
        "DISPOSITION-9": "DISPOSITION  At this point the patient will be discharged home in a\nstable but guarded condition. She will be followed by\nthe Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Departments at the Chapstone Hospital .  Her primary attending Dr. Mondelli from Sontriad University Hospitals\n( telephone number 842 322-9773 ) will be updated as to her program.\nOutstanding consults were be sorted on an outpatient basis and she\nwill be listed for a cardiac transplant. Her discharge medications\ninclude Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,\nCaptopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d , K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5\nmg p.o. t.i.d. She will also be sent home on home O2 as required.\nDigoxin will be started at 0.1 mg p.o. q d. PT and PTT levels will\nbe checked q weekly and the patient's doses changed accordingly.\nDictated By: RASHAD F. HAMLETTE , M.D. SF3\nAttending: PASQUALE R.

No ST or T wave changes.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-14": "HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. GI: Colitis: Given the patient's persistent and chronic\nnausea , vomiting , and diarrhea , there was significant concern for\nsmall bowel obstruction on admission. However , a KUB and\nabdominal CT were both negative for small bowel obstruction. She\nwas originally kept n.p.o. for bowel rest , and a nasogastric tube\nwas placed with significant drainage. Stool studies were sent\nincluding C. difficile , ova and parasites , cecal leukocytes , and\nShigella/salmonella/Yersinia/campylobacter studies , all of which\nwere negative. Because of the concerning nature of the patient's\nsymptoms , surgery consult was called , however they felt that her\nproblems were likely nonsurgical in nature. CTs performed two\ndays and five days after admission showed identical findings of\nright-sided colitis. They remained largely unchanged.\nNevertheless , the patient experienced continued nausea and\nvomiting and also continued diarrhea throughout this time. Once\nher nasogastric tube output decreased significantly ,\napproximately one week after admission , the tube was removed and\nthe patient was started on p.o. , and her diet was advanced as\ntolerated. From that point on , the patient had no nausea or\nvomiting , and she is currently tolerating a full diet.\nNevertheless , she continues to have mild diarrhea , now two\nepisodes per day as compared to6 to 8 episodes per day prior to\nadmission. In the end , the workup for the underlying cause of\nher nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea has been negative. It is\ntherefore our suspicion that her symptoms are most likely\nsecondary to toxicity from her chemotherapy medication , Xeloda.\nOf note , the patient also has other signs of Xeloda toxicity ,\nincluding possible hepatotoxicity ( see below ) as well as severe\ncracking and drying of the skin on her hands and feet.\n2. Hepatitis: A CT performed on admission to evaluate for small\nbowel obstruction showed a significantly cirrhotic and fatty\nliver with no masses. On admission , the patient's total\nbilirubin was 2.5; however , her bilirubin levels escalated\nprecipitously to a maximum of 17.6. At the same time , the\npatient developed clinical manifestations of this , including\nscleral icterus and jaundice. Also , as her albumin levels\ndecreased to below 1.5 , she developed significant ascites and\nperipheral edema. Gastroenterology consult suggested a right\nupper quadrant ultrasound , which was negative for obstruction , a\nhepatic MRI , which also showed a cirrhotic and fatty liver , and\nalso a diagnostic/therapeutic IR guided paracentesis , which\ndrained 1 liter of sterile fluid. Hepatitis serologies were also\nsent , and the patient was hepatitis A and B negative , but C\npositive; however , her viral load was less than assay , and her\nAFP was within normal limits. A rheumatologic workup for\nautoimmune hepatitis was also negative. Because of the acuteness\nand the timing of her presentation , it was felt that her liver\nfailure was likely secondary to a combination of hepatitis and\nalso toxicity from her Xeloda.\nOn discharge , the patient's hepatic function had been improving\nsignificantly for three days , with her albumin increasing , her\nINR decreasing and her bilirubin levels also decreasing. On\ndischarge , her total bilirubin was 16.0 down from 17.6 , her\nalbumin was 1.9 up from 1.5 , and her INR was 1.6 down from 2.6.\nIt is anticipated that as the patient's nutritional status\ncontinues to improve , her hepatic function will continue to\nnormalize with resulting normalization of her laboratory values.\n3. Cardiovascular: On admission , the patient was in atrial\nfibrillation with rapid ventricular response at the rate of\napproximately 140 beats per minute. She was also hypotensive ,\nwith a blood pressure of roughly 90/60. She was placed on\ncardiac telemetry , which recorded rapid a. fib. up to the 170s.\nAs a result , she was given IV Lopressor with decreased heart rate\nbut also significant reduction in her blood pressure requiring\nfluid boluses. After 24 hours , after her blood pressure had\nstabilized following the administration of intravenous fluids ,\nshe was started on a diltiazem drip at 5 mg per hour , which\nhelped to establish stable rate control in the 80s with continued\natrial fibrillation. At the same time , the patient was loaded\nwith digoxin , but her levels were high; given that the patient\nwas status post a recent admission for digoxin toxicity , this\nmedication was subsequently held. In one incident , the patient\ndeveloped a temporary junctional rhythm for approximately 5\nminutes with a heart rate in the 50s. At that point , input was\nelicited from the cardiology consult service , who thought that\nher symptoms were likely secondary to the diltiazem drip.\nHowever , given concern for a tachy-brady syndrome , the\npossibility of an implantable cardiac pacemaker was discussed.\nHowever , the patient did not have any recurrence of the\njunctional rhythm. A TTE was obtained , which showed an ejection\nfraction of 60% with trace MR and moderate TR , left and right\natrial enlargement , and normal left and right ventricular\nfunction. Once the patient was again taking p.o. medications ,\nher diltiazem drip was changed to p.o. diltiazem. For the next\nseveral days , the patient had several episodes each night of 3 to\n5 beat runs of NSVT. However , on the three days prior to\ndischarge , the patient had no events on telemetry , and her heart\nrate was stable in the 60s to 80s , with a blood pressure running\nfrom 90-100/50-60. Shortly before discharge , the patient also\ndeveloped episodic shortness of breath , which was attributed to\nmild pulmonary edema , and she responded well to boluses of IV\nLasix. As a result , she was restarted on Aldactone with\neffective gentle diuresis. The plan on discharge will be to\nfollow her volume status carefully and to adjust her diuretic\nregimen as needed to maintain her volume status with continued\nimprovement in her hepatic function.\n4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus ,\nand her metformin was held on admission secondary to an elevated\ncreatinine. As a result , she was started on a lispro sliding\nscale. Given that she was n.p.o. for several days , she was not\ngiven any insulin and her blood sugars remained stable in the low\n100s. After she again started taking p.o. , she was restarted on\na sliding scale , and she maintained excellent blood sugar control\nbetween 100 and 150. A hemoglobin A1c obtained during this\nadmission was also within normal limits. Of note , the patient\nhas a left toe ulcer , and was seen by orthopedic surgeries and\noutpatient totally before admission.\n5. Heme: The patient had an INR of 2.6 on admission secondary to\ncirrhosis and poor nutrition. As a result , she was given vitamin\nK subcu n.p.o. as needed. As noted above , despite a history of\natrial fibrillation , the patient is not on Coumadin at home\nsecondary to poor med compliance. At home , she was only on\naspirin , but this was also discontinue during the admission\nsecondary to continued guaiac positive stool. Nevertheless , her\nhematocrit remained stable throughout her admission and she did\nnot require any transfusions. As DVT prophylaxis , the patient\nwas kept on Pneumo boots throughout the admission. At one point ,\nshe was noted to have left upper extremity swelling greater than\nthe right upper extremity , but an ultrasound was negative for\nDVT. As noted above , on discharge , the patient's INR was\nimproving secondary to improved nutrition. She will be\ndischarged without any anticoagulation at present , however this\ncan be further reevaluated as an outpatient by her cardiologist\nand oncologist.\n6. FEN: The patient was initially rehydrated with normal saline ,\nhowever this was changed to D5W plus 3 amps of bicarb since she\ndeveloped a bicarb gap. Once this gap was closed , she was given\ngentle normal saline as maintenance fluids. Once the patient\nstarted taking significant p.o. , her IV fluids were discontinued.\nThe patient's electrolytes were also repleted as necessary.\nPlan on discharge will be to continue following her electrolytes\nclosely to prevent further exacerbation of her cardiac\narrhythmias.\n7. Pain: The patient was given oxycodone p.o. and morphine IV\nfor pain. The patient was previously on Vioxx at home for\northopedic pain related to her diabetes , however , given recent\ndata suggesting possible cardiotoxic effects of Vioxx , this will\nbe discontinued , and she will be sent home with oxycodone p.r.n.\nfor pain.\n8. Onc: The patient's Xeloda is currently on hold since many of\nher symptoms leading up to this admission were likely secondary\nto chemo toxicity. As noted above , the patient has other\nevidence of chemo toxicity as well , including significantly dried\nskin on her hands and feet. The patient's outpatient oncologist ,\nDr. Willard Brixius , followed her closely during this admission , and\nshe will follow up with the patient regarding possible changes to\nher chemotherapy regimen.\n9. Disposition: The patient was seen by the physical therapy\nservice shortly before discharge , and they noted that she\ndisplayed difficulty even moving from the bed to the chair , which\nis significantly below her baseline of being able to ambulate\nindependently. As a result , after extensive discussions with her\nfamily , it was decided that the patient will be best served by\ngoing to a rehab facility for continued closed supervision of her\nmedical problems , supervised administration of her medication\nregimen , continued strength training and conditioning , and also\ncontinued nutrition. Once the patient is able to be less\ndependent on outside assistance , she can be sent home with either\na home health aide or visiting nurse for continued\nrehabilitation. Of note , the patient's code status was\nestablished by her outpatient oncologist as DNR/DNI. This was\nconfirmed with the patient during this hospitalization.",

He\nalso has a history of hypothyroidism and hypocalcemia status post\ntotal thyroidectomy for premalignant lesion. The patient\npresented to an outside hospital on 2/11/05 with chest pain\nradiating down his left arm. His EKG showed STD depressions ,\ntroponin was 6.2 , creatinine was 1.4. The patient was\ntransferred to Cas Medical Center where a cardiac\ncatheterization done on 4/7/05 revealed 80% proximal LAD\nlesion , 75% proximal circumflex lesion , 100% mid RCA lesion and\nan ejection fraction of 40%.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-5": "HOSPITAL COURSE  He was admitted , made ready for surgery , taken\nto the operating room on 0/18/05 at which time he underwent a\nCABG x4 with a LIMA to the LAD and a Y sequential graft that\nconnects the saphenous vein graft to the aorta to the RCA and\nthen a sequential left radial artery graft that connects\nsaphenous vein graft to OM2 and then OM3. Intraoperatively , a\ncalcified distal ascending and aortic arch found. There was a\nsoft spot to cannulae. The patient was cooled to 22 degrees and\nthe distal RCA to the saphenous vein graft anastomosis was sewn\nunder fibrillatory arrest. Proximal to the aorta was done under\ncirculatory arrest. Proximal radial anastomosis was placed on\nthe proximal part of the saphenous vein graft to the RCA.\nImmediate postoperative course was uncomplicated. He was\ntransferred to the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #1.\nHe was neurologically intact , but been pulling at lines and\ncatheters stating he wanted them out and trying to climb out of\nbed , so he was placed on a 1:1 sitter. Nitroglycerin was weaned.\nHe was started back on Lopressor and captopril for hypertension.\nHe had an NG tube placed for gastric dilatation. He was\nextubated overnight on postoperative day #1.\nOn postoperative day #2 , he again was hypertensive. Captopril\nwas added , increased Lopressor and the diltiazem. He self DC'd\nhis Foley as well as IV on postoperative day #2 , stating he was\ngoing to leave the hospital. On postoperative day #3 , Psych was\nconsulted. They felt that imaging was warranted , however , his\nbehavior improved overnight. He was transferred to the Step-Down\nUnit on postoperative day #3. He was in sinus rhythm. His NG\ntube had been removed. His diet was being advanced as tolerated.\nHe was auto diuresing. He was back on his hypothyroid meds. On\npostoperative day #4 , he was doing well. He was mobilizing ,\ndiuresing. Physical therapy was consulted. They felt the\npatient would meet the criteria for rehabilitation. A rehab bed\nbecame available and patient was accepted on 2/11/05 . \nAt the time discharge , Mr. Dedrick looked well. His vital signs\nwere stable and he was in sinus rhythm.

Bronchoscopy - A bronchoscopy was performed on 7/4/05 and\nrevealed erythematous soft tissue in the posterior pharynx ,\ncompromising the airway above the trach tube. Granulation tissue\nwas noted above the site of the trach tube that also appeared to\npotentially compromise the airway.\n3. Modified barium swallow - modified barium swallow was\nperformed on 6/17/05 , which revealed a moderate aspiration risk.\nThe patient was recommended for a mechanical soft diet.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-14": "HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. Trach change: On admission , the patient was admitted to the\nGeneral Medical Service for problems with her trach tube. Over\nthe course of this admission , her trach tube did become dislodged\non numerous occasions. During these times , either surgery or\nrespiratory therapy were required to reinsert the trach tube.\nHowever , the patient remained stable throughout these events with\na pulse oximetry reading greater than 92% , even when the\ntube became dislodged. The patient required a Custom fit #6\nBivona cuffless trach tube. Dr. Avellano ( General Surgery ) inserted this tube\nwithout incident. Initially , the patient did feel some irritation once the\ntube was inserted , however , this resolved with deep suctioning and nebulizer\ntherapy. Once inserted , the new trach tube fit well and the\npatient was comfortable , with oxygen saturations greater than 92%\non trach mask oxygen.\n2. Redundant oropharyngeal tissue: During this admission , the\npatient underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate for possibile\ndecannulation. However , this procedure revealed\nexcessive tissue in her upper oropharynx and\nwhat appeared to be edematous tissue in the airway. The significance of this\nfinding was uncertain , although it was felt that this tissue could\ncompromise the airway if her trach tube was removed. Therefore ,\nthe patient should not be decannulated without repeat evaluation of her\nupper airway. Throughout this hospital\ncourse , the patient had her trach tube in place. She was able to\nuse a Passey-Muir valve for speaking and she may continue to use\none with her trach tube in place.\n3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of\nrecurrent pneumonia and poor pulmonary function , the patient\nunderwent a modified barium swallow evaluation for possible\naspiration pneumonia. She was found to have some difficulty\nduring this evaluation , and Speech and Swallow recommended the\npatient continue a mechanical soft diet without fluid\nrestrictions indefinitely. During this hospital course , the\npatient had been on tube feeds through her G tube , although these\nmay be tapered once the patient is tolerating oral food well.",

She has a history of chest pain since the CABG. The CABG\nconsisted of a LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein grafts to the OMB-2\nand RCA. In 8/2 , she had been cathed and a 70% RCA occlusion with\na question of thrombus was seen. A 90% OMB-2 was seen; a\ncircumflex of 60% was seen; an LAD of 70% was seen. An LV-gram\nshowed inferior akinesis and posterior hypokinesis with a left\nventricular ejection fraction of 78%. Post CABG at baseline , she\nhad substernal chest pain at rest with rare use of sublingual\nnitroglycerin. She has a history of peptic ulcer disease which was\na duodenal ulcer with melena. She had an EGD in 8/27 which showed\nmild antral gastritis without ulcers. She is status post\ncolonoscopy in 8/2 which showed diverticulitis. She has a history\nof anemia with a hematocrit of 29 , MCV of 68. She was treated with\niron sulfate and H2 blockers. She noted a history in two months of\na 20 pound weight loss. One week prior to admission , she had\nmelena of loose stool. She felt light-headed. She had a cough and\nnocturia. Three days prior to admission , she noted a stabbing\nperiodic epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting twice; no coffee\ngrounds or hematemesis. She had dysphagia for months to liquids\nand solids with the sensation of aspiration on swallowing. She had\na sharp pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath.\nThe pain was similar to the inferior MI in 1988. On 0/16 , she came\nto the emergency ward , where her blood pressure was found to be\n110/68 lying and 90/palp sitting. O2 sat was 97% on room air. Her\nJVP was 9 cm with crackles at the right base. She was given three\nsublingual nitroglycerins and Maalox. Her hematocrit was 20.8.\nShe was given 10 mg of IV Lopressor from which she became\nhypotensive , but this resolved. She was transfused three units of\npacked red blood cells , given Lasix and IV H2 blockers. She went\nto the unit and ruled out for an MI by EKG and enzymes. The A-set\nrevealed a CPK of 54; B-set was 48; C-set was 36. An ABG was 132 ,\n99 , 7.43 , 33. Potassium was 4.2 , BUN 20 , creatinine 0.9.",

She\ncomplained of some left arm pain secondary to her\nIV , but she had no EKG changes and this improved with hot\ncompresses. She was guaiac negative. On the evening of 0/12 , she\nwas noted to be trace guaiac positive in the stool. On 9/9 at 7:30\nAM , she complained of substernal chest pain which radiated to both\nupper extremities with tingling bilaterally. This did not resolve ,\neven after giving Maalox , four sublinguals and 12 mg of morphine\nand three inches of Nitropaste. Her blood pressure was stable at\n130/80 , heart rate was 68 , and she was afebrile. Her substernal\nchest pain ranged between 7-3 , and she was given 20 mEq of Kay\nCiel. Her potassium was 3.8 , hematocrit 32.8 and stable. She was\ngiven two more units of packed red blood cells after having been\ngiven two more units of packed red blood cells between 10/17 and 2/10\nIV nitroglycerin 50 units was started after one hour and 15 minutes\nof pain. This was increased to 100 units. EKG changes were noted\nas a flattening in V4 through V6 with no ST depressions , and she\nhad a T wave down in V3 which was new since admission. On 9/9 , she\nwas transferred to the unit. Her CKs were negative; A-set was 27 ,\nB-set was 29 , C-set was 57 and D-set was 65. A catheterization\nshowed right atrial pressures of 12 , PCWP of 16 , SVR 1 , 000 , PVR 76 ,\nPA 34/14 , cardiac output 6.8. Grafts from the aorta to the OM ,\naorta to the RCA and LIMA to the LAD were all patent.

There was a mild increase in right and left sided\npressures. She was readmitted to the floor and watched. Her\nhematocrit remained stable. She had an endoscopy done on the\nmorning of 3/28 , and the impression was of a large hiatal hernia\nwith no evidence of GI bleeding at this time. It was recommended\nthat she had an upper GI and small bowel follow through or repeat\ncolonoscopy in the future as an outpatient. Her hematocrit\nremained stable at approximately 33 for the past four days.

She underwent cardiac catheterization 7 of July where a\n100% proximal dominant circumflex artery stenosis was noted along\nwith 60% proximal LAD and 80% RCA stenosis.\nThe patient underwent PCA of her circumflex which at that time was\nnot successful. Postoperatively she did well , but had persistent\nchest pain. She did underwent cardiac catheterization 24 of June\nwhich revealed 40% residual stenosis of the dominant left\ncircumflex. At that time , coronary steps were placed. The patient\nhowever , continued to experience substernal chest pain and dyspnea\nover the ensuing days. The patient also experienced flash\npulmonary edema and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit. At\nthat time it was decided that her attempts at angioplasty were\nunsuccessful. She was evaluated for coronary artery bypass\ngrafting.\nShe was taken to the operating room on 9 of March where she underwent\nfour vessel bypass ( LIMA to LAD , saphenous vein graft to R1 and\nthen jumped to OM and lastly saphenous vein graft to PDA ). She\ntolerated this procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac\nIntensive Care Unit. She was maintained on triple antibiotics to\ncover the potential sequela of a superficial cordis site skin\ninfection. Sputum sent from postoperative day #1 demonstrated\nPseudomonas in her sputum. Chest x-ray showed the evolution of a\nright basilar consolidation. She was placed on ofloxacin and\npiperacillin to cover the Pseudomonas. She was slow to extubate\nbut ultimately did on 29 of March The rest of her postoperative course\nwas significant for steady wean of her oxygen requirement with\nconcomitant aggressive diuresis. She was covered with ofloxacin\nand piperacillin throughout the rest of her hospital course with\nresolution of her right lower lobe pneumonia demonstrated on chest\nx-ray. She experienced no further substernal chest pain during her\nhospitalization.\nIn the immediate postoperative period , she did experience some\nconfusion but this resolved spontaneously and her neurological exam\nwas completely nonfocal.\nThe patient was evaluated by physical therapy and it was their\nassessment that she was somewhat unable and given her living\nsituation , she was recommended for rehabilitation.\nAdditionally , her leg wounds and her chest wound have continued to\ndrain somewhat throughout the hospital course. There is no\napparent evidence of significant infection in either site.

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-3": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  This is a 73 year old gentleman with a\npast medical history of hypertension\nwho presented to Dr. Burch at the Collstate on\n4/10/94 after a couple of episodes of heavy diaphoresis and\nnausea , an identifiable precipitant. His EKG there revealed new T\nwave inversions in the inferior leads and he was admitted to the\nRexas& Hospital where he ruled out for myocardial infarction.\nWhile at Hanghab Medical Center , his EKG alternated between left anterior\nhemi-block and left posterior hemi-block. In addition , he had\nfurther episodes of nausea and diaphoresis. Because of his\nbaseline conduction system disease , an exercise tolerance test\ncould not be performed and the patient was sent for an exercise\ntolerance test thallium. However , prior to the test , the patient\nbecame diaphoretic and nauseous with a non-palpable blood pressure.\nHe was treated with an intravenous fluid bolus with subsequent\nimprovement. Because he was felt too unstable to undergo a nuclear\nimaging , he was transferred to the Hend Losblan Care to\nundergo cardiac catheterization. The patient denied any paroxysmal\nnocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , or peripheral edema. He also denied\nany recent change in exercise tolerance. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nSignificant for a history of rectal fissure , a small bowel\nobstruction , microhematuria of uncertain etiology despite an\nextensive work-up , diverticulosis , and hemorrhoids. He also has a\nhistory of degenerative joint disease and a history of mild asthma.\nHis coronary risk factors include hypertension , obesity , gender ,\nand age. ALLERGIES: None. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Calan SR 240\np.o. q.d. , Beconase two puffs b.i.d. , Brethaire two puffs q.i.d. ,\nAzmacort four puffs b.i.d. , Feldene 20 mg p.o. q.d. , and Aspirin\none p.o. q.d.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-4": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  This was a well-developed pleasant male in\nno apparent distress with a blood pressure\nof 154/82 , heart rate 74 , and respirations 14. HEENT:\nNormocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equally round and reactive to\nlight and accommodation , extraocular movements intact , and\noropharynx was benign. NECK: Supple with no jugular venous\ndistention and he had a left carotid bruit , however , his carotid\nupstrokes were normal. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.",
        "CARDIAC-5": "CARDIAC  Examination revealed a very quiet precordium with a\nregular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , gallops , or rubs.",
        "EXTREMITIES-6": "EXTREMITIES  Revealed femoral pulses 2+ without bruits , dorsalis\npedis and posterior tibial pulses 1+ bilaterally , and he had no\nclubbing , cyanosis , or edema.",
        "LABORATORY EXAMINATION-7": "LABORATORY EXAMINATION  Significant for a sodium of 140 , a\npotassium of 4.4 , BUN of 28 , creatinine\n1.7 , glucose of 110 , white count was 6.4 , hematocrit was 47.6 ,\nplatelets were 137 , 000 , his PT was 13.6 , and his PTT was 47.3. His\nchest X-Ray at Andsi Medical Center revealed an enlarged heart with\nno pulmonary infiltrates , his EKG from 2/10/94 at the Massbarre County Memorial Hospital revealed sinus bradycardia at 56 , left posterior\nhemi-block with non-specific intraventricular conduction delay , and\npoor R wave progression across his precordium. He had deep T wave\ninversion in III and F , this EKG was also notable for a pattern of\nalternating conduction delay with alternating pattern of left\nanterior and left posterior hemi-block.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization\non 10/25/94 which revealed hemodynamics of a\nright atrial mean of 6 , a right ventricular pressure of 28/6 , a\npulmonary capillary mean pressure of 14 , he had a totally occluded\nmid left anterior descending lesion , a tight second diagonal\nlesion , a totally occluded OM1 lesion , and a 70% distal right\ncoronary artery lesion. His left ventriculogram revealed\nanteroapical hypokinesis. On further analysis of the patient's\nEKG , it was felt that he alternated between left anterior\nhemi-block and left posterior hemi-block. It was felt that his\nsymptoms may be an indication of more advanced conduction system\ndisease that would possibly justify a pacer. At this point , the\ndecision was to monitor the patient with Holter monitoring and to\nperform a stress MIBI examination to assess if he degenerated to\nmore severe conduction disease. Holter monitoring on 0/19\nrevealed sinus rhythm between 40 and 85 , he had 14 hours of\noccasional atrial premature beats , two hours of occasional\nventricular premature beats , each lasting less than a minute , as\nwell as intermittent intraventricular conduction delay. He had no\nsymptoms during the 24 hours of Holter monitoring. He exercise\ntolerance test MIBI examination revealed a modified Bruce protocol\non which he went twelve minutes stopping secondary to leg fatigue ,\nhe had no chest pain , his maximum heart rate was 112 , his maximum\nblood pressure was 195/95 , he had no change in his baseline EKG as\nwell as no ST changes , and no arrhythmias. His MIBI evaluation\nrevealed a fixed inferior defect extending to the posterior septum.\nGiven the above information , particularly the fact that the patient\ndid not degenerate to more severe conduction system disease with\nexercise , it was felt that a pacer would not be necessary at this\ntime. Moreover , the patient had no provokeable ischemia by MIBI\nevaluation and it was felt that revascularization was unnecessary.\nThe decision then was to send the patient home on an adequate\nmedical regimen which was achieved during his hospital course via\nthe addition of Captopril to his medical regimen to provide him\nwith adequate blood pressure control. It is noteworthy that the\npatient had no episodes of nausea or diaphoresis during his\nhospitalization , that is ambulating without assistance with no\nsymptoms whatsoever. He is therefore felt to be stable for\ndischarge and is being discharged to home.",

The patient has a long history of coronary artery\ndisease starting in 1989. The patient presented with angina and\nruled out for a myocardial infarction at that time. In 1991 he had\nunstable angina. A catheterization revealed 100% LAD lesion\nproximally , 60% D-1 , 70% distal left circumflex , and normal right\ncoronary artery. PTCA to the LAD was performed with 30% residual\nlesion. In 1992 the patient had two myocardial infarctions. In\nFebruary of 1992 a re-catheterization showed an additional lesion of\nan OM-2 with 60% complex lesion with a mid LAD total occlusion with\nright-to-left collaterals and diffuse PDA disease. In February of\n1992 a repeat catheterization was performed for continued unstable\nangina and the patient had an 80% left circumflex lesion , a 70%\nOM-2 , 100% proximal LAD , 70% distal left circumflex , 70% OM-2.\nOver this time period between 1991 and 1992 , the patient had a\ntotal of four myocardial infarctions including a large anterior\nwall myocardial infarction. The patient underwent coronary artery\nbypass grafting in February of 1992 which was complicated by\nventricular fibrillation arrest in the postoperative Intensive Care\nUnit. The patient received a LIMA to the LAD , SVG to the OM-1 and\nan SVG to the OM-2. The patient had a repeat catheterization in\nFebruary of 1994 for unstable angina which showed diffuse native\ndisease: 100% LAD with right-to-left collaterals , 70% distal left\ncircumflex , 100% proximal OM-1 , 100% OM-2 , 50% mid right coronary\nartery. The grafts were patent. Since that time the patient has\nhad minimal chest pain. The patient was seen in the clinic most\nrecently in March of 1997 for exertional chest pain. The patient\ndid well with an increase in his Atenolol dose.\nOn the day of admission today , for this admission , the patient\nexperienced chest burning at rest while watching TV with no\nemotional or exertional stress. The pain lasted 40 minutes ,\nradiating to the jaw with an intensity of 8 out of 10. The patient\ntook a shower without relief , took five sublingual Nitroglycerin\ntablets without relief. The patient presented to the Emergency Ward\nwhere his pain was relieved in the Waiting Room. The patient had\nno nausea or vomiting , diaphoresis or shortness of breath. The\npatient has had no increasing dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea or PND\nrecently; however the patient is not physically active.

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-9": "HOSPITAL COURSE  1 ) Cardiovascular\nclinically volume overloaded. He was diuresed\nwith torsemide IV boluses with good response. He was diuresing two\nliters negative per day on torsemide IV or p.o. as well as\nspironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. However , his clinical volume status\nwere difficult to assess and accordingly on 7/10/02 he underwent\nright heart catheterization and tailored therapy. By report his\nright atrial pressure on right heart catheterization was 17 , his\nwedge pressure was 43 and pulmonary artery pressure was 65/37\nindicating that he still has substantial volume overload. On\ntherapy his vasodilators were cautiously added to decrease his\nsystemic vascular resistance and total vascular resistance with\nsuccess with low doses of Captopril. His PA catheter was\ndiscontinued on 5/9/02. He has continued to be diuresed with\ntorsemide 10 p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. He should\nbe at or near euvolemia on 2/28/02 and he was discharged on a\ndiuretic regimen of torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and spironolactone\n25 mg p.o.q.d. in addition to Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.\nIschemia: There were no ischemic issues during this hospital\nadmission.\nRhythm: Electrocardiogram with first degree AV block. The patient\nwas monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital course. No\nevidence of significant arrhythmias were noted. No further workup\nwas pursued from a rhythm standpoint.\n2 ) Endocrine: The patient had a history of hypothyroidism. It is\nunclear how this came to be but at some point in the past his\nSynthroid had been stopped and only relatively recently restarted.\nHe had been maintained at a dose of 225 mcg q.d. in the past. When\nhe was restarted on Synthroid by the outpatient endocrinologist ,\nDr. Escudero , his Synthroid was started at a relatively low dose and\ntitrated slowly upwards because of his severe cardiomyopathy and\nthere was concern that increasing his dose too quickly would\nprecipitate angina. On admission his TSH was 50 and after some\ndiscussion with Dr. Pimpare his Synthroid was increased to 125 mcg\np.o.q.d. On 5/16/02 an endocrine consult was requested because on\n2/14/02 his repeat TSH of 75.8 , T4 of 6.5 and a THBR of 1.10.\nEndocrine consult recommended increasing Synthroid to 150 mcg\np.o.q.d. and slowly titrating Synthroid upwards by no more than 25\nmcg q. 3-4 weeks to a goal of 200 mcg per day , again slowly\ntitrating upwards to reduce the risk of precipitating angina.\nFurther management of his hypothyroidism could be done on an\noutpatient basis.\nThe patient also on admission had a history of Type II diabetes\nmaintained on insulin. His insulin doses had been titrated\ndownwards during his hospital diabetes mellitus because of low\nfingersticks , likely secondary to a relatively healthy diet while\nin the hospital. He required only 60 units of Lantus insulin q.\na.m. He was discharged on that dose with Humalog 10 units subcu q.\na.m. and q. p.m. to be followed and possibly titrated back upwards\nby his outpatient endocrinologist , Dr. Wakeham\n3 ) Psychiatric: The patient had a history of depression and\nduring this admission he was maintained on his outpatient\nmedications of Prozac and Restoril. His Prozac dose was titrated\nupwards to 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. without any notable side effects. He\nwas discharged on this dose , 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. No further\npsychiatric evaluation or interventions were required during his\ninpatient stay. His mood remained stable during this admission.\n4 ) Renal: The patient's creatinine was monitored throughout his\nhospital course remaining relatively stable despite diuresis. No\nfurther renal evaluation or intervention was required during this\nhospital stay.",

She was an obese lady lying on\nher back. HEAD AND NECK: Revealed no evidence of trauma. There\nwere no bruits in the neck. CHEST: Clear. There were bilateral\nwheezes. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Normal , obese\nwith no edema. NEURO: The patient is awake and alert , looking\naround. She was mute however. She was able to follow one step\ncommands. She had a question of a right field compromise\ndifficulty crossing the midline. She had a right upper motor\nneuron seventh weakness with decreased power on the right side of\nthe face. She had flaccid right arm. Her right leg had some power\nwith flexion at the knee but was generally weak. She had optimum\ncoordination and absent pinprick and proprioception on the right.\nAll of this was documented at 12:30 a.m. By 14;30 a.m. , after the\npatient was given intravenous TPA , the patient's language had\nreturned completely to normal. She had normal speech including\ncomprehension and naming. Her ability to distinguish left from\nright was intact. Her repetition was intact. SHe had full range of\nmovement of the eyes with full fields of confrontation. She had a\nmild right arm drift on the right side but her strength was 4+/5\ndistally and proximally. There was normal power in the right lower\nlobe and the plantars were normal. There was no increase in\nreflexes. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit\nfor the neurological service of Teaspell Diee Hospital . ",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "HOSPITAL COURSE  Blood pressure monitoring was instituted per\nprotocol , nasal oxygen was given and no antiplatelet\ntherapy was given for 24 hours. Head of bed was raised to 30\ndegrees. Head CT was repeated the following morning , the results\nof which show that there is slight left basal ganglion internal\ncapsule , acute and subacute infarct in the left middle cerebral\nartery distribution which was evolving from the previous study.\nTHere was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. The patient had\nfurther investigations to look for a cause of this presumed embolic\nstroke. She had an echocardiogram done which showed the aortic\nroot at 3.5 cm , the atrium at 3.2 which is slightly dilated. There\nwas normal ventricular size and overall preserved systolic\nfunction , trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation ,\ntrace mitral regurgitation. Holter monitor was done which showed\npersistent atrial flutter. The patient was coumadinized and some\ndiscussion pertaining to cardioversion was entertained by the\nelectrophysiology service. However , this was not done as an\ninpatient. The patient continued to do remarkably well after her\nintravenous thrombolysis over the next couple of days. She had\npersistent drift on the right arm; however , her speech remained\ncompletely normal. SHe was reviewed by the chronic pain service on\nseveral occasions for chronic back and leg pain. She reached\nnormal levels of Coumadin within several days and was discharged\nwithout rehabilitation. She will be followed by the cardiac\nservice and a plan for complete cardioversion was instituted within\none month. The patient went home on Coumadin. She was finally\ndischarged on 0/21/99 . \nDictated By: HAROLD ULLMANN , M.D. HQ91\nAttending: IAN M. LAJEUNESSE , M.D. IX83  RO255/5843\nBatch: 74024 Index No. B7NM1543EG D: 6/6/99",

The following day , he went back to his primary care\nprovider and was given cough syrup with Codeine , but without relief\nand through the course of that day , he developed increasing\nshortness of breath , chills and diaphoresis and so he presented to\nthe emergency room. In the emergency room , he had a temperature of\n100 degrees with room air oxygen saturations between 90% and 95%.\nHe was cultured and a chest x-ray was taken which showed a right\nmiddle lobe infiltrate and therefore , he was admitted with a\ncommunity acquired pneumonia resistant to outpatient management.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient is a 65 year-old male with diabetes\nmellitus , coronary artery disease and sleep apnea\nwho was admitted with a community acquired pneumonia who had failed\noutpatient management. He was initially started on intravenous\nCefuroxime and Azithromycin for likely community acquired bacterial\npathogens and atypical organisms. He was cultured and sputums were\nobtained , however no organisms were ever isolated throughout his\nhospital course. On hospital day number two , he developed\nincreasing shortness of breath with oxygen saturations of roughly\n86% on six liters. At this time , his lung examination was notable\nfor marked increase in the inspiratory and expiratory wheezes with\ndecreased air movements. The rest of his examination at this time\nincluding the cardiac examination was unremarkable. This event was\nfelt to be bronchospasm due to airway inflammation and he was\ntreated with numerous Albuterol nebulizers and intravenous Lasix on\nwhich his oxygenation gradually improved to 96% on six liters.\nBecause of the concern of reactive airway disease and perhaps\nworsening pneumonia , he was at this time switched to Legionella\ndoses of Azithromycin and was started on aggressive nebulizer\ntreatments. However , at this time , the possibility of flash\npulmonary edema causing cardiac problems was also raised. However ,\nit was noted at this time that there was no clear precipitant for\nan episode of flash pulmonary edema and that his blood pressure was\nat baseline. His heart rate was at 70 and he had not become\nobviously fluid overloaded. Nonetheless , he received a cardiac\nwork-up which concluded that he was being ruled out for a\nmyocardial infarction and the following day , he received an\nechocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 58% with\napical inferior and inferoseptal akinesis. There was no marked\nleft ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore , it was thought unlikely\nthat flash pulmonary edema had significantly contributed to his\nhypoxia and he was subsequently treated solely for severe community\nacquired pneumonia with a large bronchospastic component. He was\ntherefore continued on Cefuroxime and Azithromycin with gradual\nresolution of his fevers and a significant improvement in his air\nmovement and his pulmonary examination. Two weeks prior to this\nadmission , he was started on a Prednisone taper and subsequent\nunderwent marked improvement in his air movement and in the degree\nof bronchospasm. Therefore , he was discharged home on the\nfollowing medications.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM-23": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM \n1. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with hyperglycemia and\nsugar in the 600s. The patient was initially started on insulin\ndrip at 4 units per hour , and her sugars quickly normalized. The\npatient was transitioned over to subcutaneous insulin regimen\nthat included Lantus and q.a.c. aspartate as well as sliding\nscale. The patient's fingersticks remained labile throughout\nthis admission and at times were elevated in the 300s and other\ntimes were normal in the range of 70 to 90. The patient's\ninsulin was titrated , and she was discharged on a regimen that\nincluded Lantus 90 units subcutaneously daily as well as\naspartate 28 units subcutaneously before each meal. It was\nnoticed that the patient had the most difficulty with\npostprandial sugars often after lunch and dinner. Therefore , we\nrecommended that if she continues to have hyperglycemia , that it\nwould be best to titrate the q.a.c. aspartate. It would be best\nto avoid titrating the Lantus too much given that her fasting\nsugar in the morning was often normal. The patient had no\nhypoglycemic episodes during this admission. Of note , the\npatient was not previously on q.a.c. insulin dosing at home;\nhowever , following discharge from rehabilitation , it was thought\nthat this would not likely be the best regimen for her. This was\ndiscussed with the patient's family and caregivers who were\namenable to this idea , however , will likely need further\nteaching.\n2. GI: The patient has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis\ncomplicated by ascites and esophageal varices. The patient was\nthought to be grossly volume overloaded due to her cirrhosis and\nhypoalbuminemia on admission. The patient was initially diuresed\nwith IV Lasix with good results. The patient did have a bump in\nher creatinine due to this aggressive diuresis and her Lasix was\nheld for several days , but her oral Lasix was restarted prior to\ndischarge. The patient was discharged on 60 mg of p.o. Lasix\ntwice daily. The patient on admission was thought to have\nsignificant amount of ascites based on abdominal exam. The\npatient had recently completed a course of treatment for\nspontaneous bacterial peritonitis and had no abdominal tenderness\nbut did have distention. An abdominal ultrasound was obtained as\na diagnostic paracentesis was considered given that the patient\nhad an episode of confusion; however , abdominal ultrasound\nrevealed only a small lot of ascites that was not amenable to\nparacentesis. The patient has a history of esophageal varices\nand was continued on her nadolol for prophylaxis. The patient\nwas continued on her Bactrim for SBP prophylaxis. The patient\ndid have an episode of confusion and delirium during this\nadmission , which was felt to be likely due to hepatic\nencephalopathy. The patient's delirium improved with the\ninitiation of lactulose. The patient was discharged on lactulose\n30 mL q.i.d. , which we titrated so that the patient has at least\n3 bowel movements daily. At the time of discharge , the patient\nwas alert and oriented. Of note , the patient was not started on\nAldactone for management of her volume overload given that she\nwas admitted with hyperkalemia and has a history of elevated\npotassium.\n3. Neurologic: The patient had had one episode of delirium\nduring this admission where she was confused , did not know where\nshe was , and was not interacting with her family appropriately.\nThe patient had a workup at that time , which included an\ninfectious workup , which revealed no evidence of infection. The\npatient was started on lactulose , which had to be an administered\ninitially by retention enema as she was refusing to take p.o.\nThe patient's mental status improved within 24 hours of starting\nthe lactulose , and she was continued on this regimen and will be\ndischarged on it. Of note , the patient had no asterixis on\ndischarge.\n4. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease\nwith a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.7. The patient was\nadmitted with a creatinine of 1.6 , which did increase slightly\nwith increased diuresis. The patient's Lasix was held for a day\nor two and then she was restarted on her oral home Lasix regimen ,\nwhich was titrated to 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. Of note , the patient's\nlisinopril was held on admission due to hyperkalemia. The\nlisinopril was not restarted prior to discharge given the\npatient's history of hyperkalemia and several episodes during\nthis admission , which required the administration of Kayexalate.\nThe patient likely should be on an ACE inhibitor for chronic\nkidney disease , but this can be re-added as an outpatient with\nvery close monitoring of her potassium as this was felt to be\nindicated by the patient's primary care physician. Of note , the\npatient was normotensive off lisinopril during this admission.\n5. Pulmonary: The patient has history of IPF and had no acute\npulmonary issues during this admission. The patient was\nsaturating well on her home dose of O2 throughout the entire\nadmission. The patient was continued on her home dose of\ndexamethasone for IPF.\n6. Infectious Disease: Prior to discharge , the patient was\nincidentally noted to have a urine culture that was growing\ngreater than 100 , 000 colonies. The patient was afebrile and had\nno symptoms of dysuria but did have a mildly elevated white count\nof 11 , 000. Based on the patient's recent UTI , she was started on\ncefpodoxime for a short 5-day course. Results of this urine\nculture will need to be followed up and her antibiotics adjusted\nas necessary. The patient was continued on her Bactrim for both\nSPEP and PCP prophylaxis.",

For her heart\nfailure , she was diuresed with IV and transitioned to oral\ntorsemide and they entered discharge dose of torsemide 200 mg\np.o. twice per day. Her admission weight was 133 kg and her\ndischarge weight 122 kg. She should continue on her current\ntorsemide and limit her daily salt intake , and restrict herself\nto 2 liters per day for her right upper extremity cellulitis.\nShe was given a five-day course of levofloxacin ( used to address\nrecurrent UTI ) and then a two-day course of Ancef , her cellulitis\ncleared with this regimen. For her urinary tract infection , she\nwas initially treated with levofloxacin and transitioned to\nBactrim based on antibiogram sensitivities. A long-term Foley\ncatheter was removed. Repeat cultures showed bacteria in her\nurine; however , she was clinically asymptomatic , it was felt that\nthis is more consistent with colonization and no further\ntreatment was instituted. If needed for further antibiotics , a\nPICC line was placed on March , 2005 , after her prior PICC\nline clotted. Prior to discharge , a new Foley catheter was\nplaced and she was incontinent of urine and overall more\ncomfortable with catheter in place. While on Bactrim for her\nUTI , her creatinine rose to a peak of 2.0 , it was unclear whether\nthis raise was due to diuresis or the antibiotic. With cessation\nof the antibiotic , her creatinine trended downward to her\nbaseline at 1.6. For her chronic anemia , the patient was\ncontinued on iron ( which was increased to three times per day )\nand darbepoetin , folate was added. She was asymptomatic from her\nchronic anemia. She was given two units of packed red blood\ncells in March , 2005 , and two more units on February ,\n2005 , and she responded appropriately to this. Her discharge\nhematocrit was 30.

She was treated\nwith intravenous Lopressor and Lasix and ruled out for a myocardial\ninfarction. One day prior to admission , the patient noted the\nonset of increasing shortness of breath and wheezing. She had a\ncough productive of yellow sputum. She was seen in the Emergency\nRoom and at that time , was afebrile with an O2 saturation of 93% on\nroom air. She was in atrial fibrillation at 100 and her\nlaboratories were within normal limits. She was discharged to\nhome. She returned to the Emergency Ward several hours later with\npersistent shortness of breath now complaining of substernal chest\npain. She did have a temperature of 101 at this point and she was\nadmitted for further evaluation. She was given Lasix 20 mg\nintravenously in the Emergency Room.",

All cultures , blood\nand sputum cultures , were negative and her chest X-Ray the next day\nwas clear suggesting that the patient most likely had a\ntracheobronchitis rather than an actual pneumonia. From a cardiac\nstandpoint , she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction\nprotocol. She ruled out , she was given increased diuresis , and her\nrales and wheezes improved. Over the next several days , she did\nwell , however , she did have still some evidence of congestive heart\nfailure on examination. An echo was obtained which showed an\nejection fraction of 50 to 55% with normal left ventricular size.\nThe patient was therefore changed from Digoxin to Diltiazem 60\nt.i.d. for her rate control for atrial fibrillation. Her Lasix\ndose was also increased to 40 mg p.o. q.d. The Atenolol was\ndiscontinued. The patient did very well on this regimen. She had\nno further evidence of rales or wheezing and her congestive heart\nfailure seemed to be in much better control.

Just\nprior to his admission , he was seen by Dr. Frankie Krampitz of Harlsti Conon Memorial Medical Center cardiology and was cleared from a cardiac\nstandpoint saying that he was an average risk for surgery as he has\ndone well from his prior surgeries and has had no symptoms since\nhis bypass surgery. Additionally , his preoperative angiogram\nshowed his superficial femoral artery graft to be proximally\noccluded with mid to distal reconstitution. Above the knee\npopliteal artery , there was mild diffuse disease. Below the knee\npopliteal was patent. There was diffuse proximal disease in the\nperoneal and posterior tibial arteries. The posterior tibial\noccludes above the knee and there is high grade focal stenosis at\nthe anterior tibial origin. The dorsalis pedis is patent.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  On 5/21/99 the patient was brought to the\noperating room where Dr. Moises performed a left\nfemoral above-the-knee popliteal bypass graft. This went without\ncomplications. The type of graft used as a 6 mm Dalcron graft.\nThe immediate postoperative pulse examination was notable for a\npalpable femoral popliteal and graft pulse with a Dopplerable\ndorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse on left side. The\npatient had an ECG postoperatively that showed no significant\nchange to his preoperative ECG. He was started on heparin at 8\np.m. the day of surgery.\nOf note , on postoperative day #1 , the patient got very diaphoretic\nand nauseous. At that time an ECG was done that showed no\nsignificant change and , throughout that episode , he had no\nhemodynamic instability. This was likely secondary to having\ngotten up rather quickly and likely a vasovagal event.\nThroughout the rest of his hospitalization course the patient was\nmobilized with physical therapy. He had a Dopplerable dorsalis\npedis pulse , posterior tibial pulse , and peroneal pulse on left\nside throughout his entire hospital course. However , the graft was\nno longer palpable by postoperative day #2 but it was strongly\nDopplerable.\nThe patient was continued on heparin until his Coumadin reached the\nhigh 1 level which was achieved on 5/26/99 when his INR was 1.6. At\nthis time his heparin was discontinued. The anticoagulation is on\nfor keeping the graft patent and not for any cardiac or stroke\nreasons. The goal on his INR will be approximately 2 to 2.5. On\n5/26/99 the patient was stable for discharge. His pulse examination\nwas notable for Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior\ntibial pulse and peroneal pulse.\nThe patient's record of Coumadin in response with INR is as\nfollows: On 5/21/99 the patient was started on Coumadin at which\npoint his INR was 1.0. On that day he got 5 mg of Coumadin. The\nfollowing day , 9/28/99 , his INR was 1.1 and he got another 5 mg of\nCoumadin. On 1/30/99 the patient's INR was 1.2 and he got another 5\nmg of Coumadin. On 10/28/99 the patient got 7.5 mg of Coumadin and\nhis INR was 1.2 at that time. On 0/6/99 the patient got 10 mg of\nCoumadin and his INR was 1.6 the following day on the day of\ndischarge , 10/14/99. On the day of discharge , 5/26/99 , the patient\nwill get 7.5 mg of Coumadin and his predicted daily dose will be\nroughly 7.5 mg of Coumadin p.o. q.d.",

The source of\nhistory was the patient , who was a moderate historian and the old\nchart. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: According to the patient , she\nfirst presented to the medical system in 1989. At that time she\nwas walking at home and became dizzy. She was taken to Meeville Valley Health in Rhode Island She was told that she had a heart\nattack and was placed on a monitor when she was noted to have an\nepisode of asystole on the monitor. This led to emergent pacer\ninsertion. After pacer placement , the dizziness never recurred\nuntil a few months ago. This led to hospitalization on March , 1994\nat Xas*tu Hospital Medical Center .  She was seen by the pacer service\nwho interrogated her pacer and found it functioning normally.\nHowever , the pacer lead type ( MECHRONIC 4012 ) is felt to have a\nhigh failure rate , necessitating a new pacer insertion.\nUnfortunately , the patient left AMA before the procedure could be\nperformed.\nToday , the patient got out of bed and preceded to the bathroom ,\nwhere she had a normal bowel movement without any symptoms. She\ngot up from the toilet and while walking back to bed became dizzy\nagain. She subsequently passed out for an undetermined time.\nAfter waking up she knew exactly where she was and had no\npost-ictal symptoms. She fell to the floor , but denies any trauma.\nShe also denied urinary/fecal incontinence during this episode.\nShe adamantly denies chest pain , shortness of breath or significant\npalpitations. She presented today to the ER for evaluation.\nMedications on admission - None. No known drug allergies. PAST",

Considering her history , it was felt that she certainly\nhad a symptomatic bradycardic episode. Because her current\npacemaker had a very high failure rate , we recommended changing the\npacemaker and the patient agreed. She was placed on the cardiac\nmonitor without any event over her hospital stay.\nAs part of her prepacer work-up , she had a right upper extremity\nvenogram which showed patent vessels on that side. The patient had\na pacemaker insertedon 4 of October in the OR without any complications.\nThe reason it was done in the OR was because of her large size and\nthe strength of the table. After pacer insertion , the patient did\nvery well without any further symptoms of dizziness or syncope. She\nwas discharged to home the following day in good condition.",

Patient had a history of variegate porphyria\nfor about fifteen years , was followed by Dr. Nigel Wickenhauser , and she\nhad been relatively free of porphyria attacks with the last major\none approximately twelve years ago with symptoms similar to those\nshe was experiencing at the time of this admission. In May\n1994 , she had a mild porphyria attack which was managed by stopping all\nher medications. She intermittently had skin lesions ,\nespecially with sun exposure. She had never been phlebotomized or\nreceived other treatments. In the past two months , she had been\ntaking Ativan of 3-4 mg q.d. for anxiety. She stopped taking\nAtivan on March , 1995 and after this abrupt stopping of this\nmedication , she started to have feelings of disorientation ,\nconfusion , and fatigue with emotional lability. She also was in\nIdaho with extensive sun exposure in the last two weeks. She\ncontacted Dr. Furuya who advised her to increase her carbohydrate\nintake to about 400 grams a day , however , her symptoms progressed.\nTwo days prior to admission , she felt weak and while standing , her\nlegs gave way without losing consciousness. She felt weak\nthroughout the week before admission with no vertigo , tinnitus , or\nataxia. She also felt paresthesias of the hands and feet but not\nperioral and she also experienced episodes of flushing and\ntremulousness with a feeling of rushing sensation in the chest with\nno tachycardia associated at the time of this symptomatology. She\nhad no fevers with the sensation of flushing and feeling of burning\nup. She had several bouts of diarrhea intermingled with\nconstipation. On the day of admission , patient became confused and\ndisoriented while driving and she came to see Dr. Heyn in the\nVVH Clinic. She was admitted for evaluation of a possible\nporphyria attack.

Neurology consultation was obtained who felt that\npatient's peripheral neuropathy was probably secondary to\nlongstanding diabetes but felt that some of her symptomatology\ncould be consistent with porphyria. Patient was also seen by\nPsychiatry who felt that this episode was consistent with\ngeneralized anxiety disorder separated by post dysthymia and\nsuggested phenothiazines which are proven to be safe in porphyria\nfor treatment. She was started on Trilafon 2 to 4 mg p.o. p.r.n.\nq.6h. for anxiety. The patient was also seen to be orthostatic\nwhich was felt to be secondary to dehydration secondary to poor\np.o. intake prior to admission. She was also hyperglycemic on\nadmission which may have contributed to her dehydration. She was\ntreated with normal saline boluses and her orthostasis improved.\nHer Lopressor was also held with this episode of orthostasis. The\nWatson-Schwartz test done by Dr. Mohar on patient very early in the admission\nwas negative which made an acute porphyria attack very\nunlikely. These episodes were felt to be secondary to a\ncombination of anxiety attack and rapid taper of Ativan which she\nhad been taking at moderately high doses for the last two months.\nPatient also developed urinary tract infection symptoms and her\nurine culture showed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of E. coli which\nwere pansensitive.

On the day of admission , the patient's children and\nVNA were unable to get in touch with him and came to his house ,\nwhere he was sitting too weak to answer the door. At that time ,\nhe was apparently confused and disoriented. The patient reports\nfeeling poorly for about two years since his diagnosis with giant\ncell arteritis , but denied any acute change over the past several\ndays prior to admission. He denied focal weakness , slurred\nspeech , bowel or bladder incontinence , loss of consciousness and\nhad no witnessed seizure activity. He also denied chest pain , palpitations ,\nshortness of breath , increased dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea ,\nand also had no report of fever , cough , dysuria , urinary\nfrequency , diarrhea , abdominal pain , jaw claudication , calf\ntenderness , or vision loss. He did think that he had recently\nlost weight and has chronic lower extremity edema and chronic\nright shoulder pain. In the ED , he was afebrile with pulse of\n78 , blood pressure 124/60 , and breathing 16 times per minute.\nHis potassium was noted to be low. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary\nedema and head CT was negative. He received potassium and\nmagnesium repletion as well as oxycodone for right shoulder pain\nand was admitted for weakness in the setting of hypokalemia and\nvolume overload.",

        "ADMISSION EKG-12": "ADMISSION EKG  Normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 78 , T wave\ninversions in aVL , which were old.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-13": "HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. ID - The patient developed hypotension on the morning of\n11/0/05 . He was given IV fluids , stress dose steroids , and\nstarted on broader antibiotic coverage ( vancomycin and\nlevofloxacin ). He was also started on acyclovir with concern for\nencephalopathy in the setting of increased lethargy and\nright-sided deficits reported earlier that morning. He responded\nto IV fluids and did not require pressor support. A lumbar\npuncture was attempted and was unsuccessful. His blood cultures\nfrom 11/0/05 in the a.m. grew gram-negative rods and antibiotics\nwhich were changed to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for double\ngram-negative coverage. The other cultures grew one out of four\npansensitive pseudomonas and one out of four Bacteroides fragilis\nand his antibiotics were changed to ceftazidime , levofloxacin ,\nand Flagyl. The acyclovir was stopped. Blood cultures were\nrepeated on the evening of 11/0/05 and were negative. He was\ndischarged home with a PICC line to complete a 14-day course of\nantibiotics. At the time of discharge , the patient was afebrile\nand vital signs were stable. His white blood cell count was\nelevated likely secondary to steroids. The source of his\nbacteremia was unclear , but most likely a bowel origin given its\nspecies and would consider microperforation as the possibility.\nA follow-up colonoscopy may be considered as an outpatient.\nOther sources include sinusitis and recent removal of a left leg\nulcer , but were unlikely to result in pseudomonas and\nBacteroides.\n2. Neuro - The patient presented with generalized nonfocal\nweakness. On the morning of 11/0/05 , he developed focal\nright-sided weakness , aphasia , and lethargy/confusion. Stat head\nCT/CTA and neuro consult were done and the patient was started on\nacyclovir for concern of CNS infection. Lumbar puncture was\nattempted but was unsuccessful. CTA was negative for acute stroke\nand MRI/MRA was also done and was negative. The patient's\nright-sided deficits were transient and the patient's mental\nstatus also improved during the rest of his hospitalization. The\ncause of his acute symptoms were unclear , but included giant cell\narteritis exacerbation , recrudescence of previous stroke ,\ntransient hypotension from sepsis and TIA. Interestingly , on\nreview of his chart , it was also found that the initial ED\nnursing note per EMS reported right-sided weakness , which must\nhave been transient as well because the ED physician note was\nwithout focality.\n3. CV/Pulm - ( I ) The patient denied chest pain and troponin was\nnegative x 2. He was continued on aspirin and statin and\nrestarted on beta-blocker when his blood pressures improved.\n( P ) - The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart\nfailure and was admitted with mild pulmonary edema on chest\nx-ray. He was initially given Lasix , but was discontinued on the\nmorning 11/0/05 in the setting of hypertension. He also\ncomplained of shortness of breath at that time , but chest x-ray\nwas repeated , which showed clear lungs. His sats were 94 to 95%\non two to three liters of oxygen. He required aggressive fluid\nresuscitation for his hypotension , which he tolerated well. He\nagain became short of breath on the morning of 4/17/05 and was\nthought to be mildly volume overloaded. He was given IV Lasix and\nrestarted on daily p.o. Lasix. He was discharged on 40 mg p.o.\nb.i.d. Lasix.\n( R ) - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and status\npost DC cardioversion. He presented in sinus rhythm. He did\nrequire IV Lopressor and verapamil for rapid rate atrial flutter\non 9/4/05 to 4/17/05 , which was somewhat refractory to\ntreatment. However , his rate quickly improved on placement of a\nFoley in the setting of difficulty voiding and a large bladder\nresidual. At the time of discharge , he was restarted on his home\ndose of atenolol.\n4. Renal - The patient presented with chronic renal\ninsufficiency , which remained stable during his hospitalization.\nHis creatinine ranged from 1.5 to 1.9. The patient's Foley\ncatheter was removed on 9/4/05 and the patient began to\ncomplain of urinary frequency and urgency on 4/17/05 .\nUrinalysis and urine culture were negative. However , postvoid\nresidual was one liter and his Foley was replaced. On discharge ,\nhe was given a trial to void , which was not completed. It was\nrecommended that the patient be discharged with a Foley , but was\ndeclined. The patient and his family were informed of our recommendation. He\nhas VNA services scheduled who are aware\nof his urinary difficulty and should check postvoid residual and replace the\nFoley or teach straight cath as needed.\n5. Heme - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and\nwas previously on Coumadin anticoagulation. However , his\nCoumadin was stopped several days prior to admission for left leg\nulcer excision and presented subtherapeutic with an INR of 1.2.\nHis Coumadin was held during his stay in the MICU , but was\nrestarted prior to discharge. He will be followed by CMH\nAnticoagulation and should be closely monitored in the setting of\nantibiotics. On discharge , his INR was 1.6.\n6. Derm - The patient had a left leg ulcer excision several days\nprior to admission. The patient should have sutures removed\nafter discharge at two weeks post excision. The site was an\nunlikely source of his bacteremia.\n7. Rheum/Endocrine- The patient has a history of giant cell\narteritis. ESR was elevated to 99 on admission. The patient was\ninitially continued on home dose Medrol. However , on the morning\nof 11/0/05 , in the setting of right-sided weakness , mental\nstatus change , and hypotension , the patient was changed to\nhigh-dose Solu-Medrol with concern for his GCA\nexacerbation/vasculitis. When the cultures grew preliminary\ngram-negative rods and MRI of the brain was negative for\nvasculitis , he was changed to stress dose hydrocortisone.\nSteroids were tapered during hospitalization and the patient was\ndischarged on a continued taper back over one week to his home dose Medrol 10\nmg per day. The patient was also on glyburide as an outpatient\nfor diabetes mellitus. As an inpatient , he was given insulin for\nmore aggressive control. On discharge , the patient was to\ncontinue on twice per day insulin 70/30 while recovering and\ntapering steroids. As an outpatient , it may be considered to\nresume his oral agents in place of insulin.\n8. Access- The patient had a right internal jugular central\nvenous line placed in the MICU , which was discontinued prior to\ndischarge. A PICC line was placed for home antibiotics.\n9. FEN- The patient presented with hypokalemia to 2.9 and required\nmultiple doses of repletion. At the time of discharge , his\npotassium was 3.1 and received additional potassium on that day.\nHe was discharged on a regimen of 40 mEq of potassium chloride\nper day. He will need his potassium to be rechecked as an\noutpatient in the setting of receiving daily Lasix. However ,\nthere was concern for more aggressive outpatient repletion in the\nsetting of chronic renal insufficiency.\n10. Prophylaxis- The patient was given Nexium and Lovenox.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM \n1. Cardiovascular. In terms of pump , the patient was clearly in\ngross volume overload from both the right sided and left-sided\nfailure on presentation. Her blood pressure was stable and she\nhad no evidence of severely decreased cardiac output or/and organ\nperfusion. She was started on the Lasix drip at 10 mg per hour\nand Zaroxolyn at 2.5 mg p.o. daily. Her Lopressor was held for a\ndecompensated heart failure. She initially diuresed well\novernight; however , on the second day her diuresis tapered off\nand her Lasix drip was turned up to 20 mg per hour and the\nZaroxolyn was increased to b.i.d. She met her I&amp;O goal of\ngreater than 1 liter negative overnight the following night ,\nhowever , a day later , she again had poor diuresis and the\nZaroxolyn was changed to Diuril. At this time , a repeat chest\nx-ray showed a very little change in her bilateral pleural\neffusions , so her diuresis up to this point was felt to be\ninsufficient. After the transition from Zaroxolyn to Diuril ,\nwhich was given 250 mg IV b.i.d. , she was noted to have an\nincrease in creatinine from 2.9. gradually up to 3.2; however ,\nremained stable for the next few days and the patient was able to\nmaintain good diuresis on this regimen without bump in her\ncreatinine.\nOn 6/27/2006 , she was noted to have greatly improved lower\nextremity edema and that improved lung exam and she had met her\ngoal weight of less than 85 kilograms. Lasix drip was\ndiscontinued in the afternoon on 6/27/2006 and she was restarted\non her home p.o. torsemide regimen of 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 50\nmg p.o. q.p.m. for anticipated discharge home on 5/15/2006 .  The\nDiuril was also discontinued. The patient was anticipated to be\nstable on b.i.d. torsemide and p.o. on metolazone at home. Her\nnew dry weight on this admission was established at 85 kilograms\nand this should be at a goal for diuresis should she require\nadmission in the future.\nShe will follow up with her CSH cardiologist for further\nmonitoring of her volume status after discharge. In terms of\nrhythm , the patient had a new presentation of atrial fibrillation\non the prior admission and was started on amiodarone and Coumadin\nat that time. She was in normal sinus rhythm on presentation at\nthis admission and remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the\nadmission and was monitored on telemetry with no other events.\nShe was continued on her home dose of amiodarone and continued on\nCoumadin; however despite the dose being decreased from her home\ndose of 1 mg q.p.m. to a 0.5 mg q.p.m. , her INR continued to rise\nand was eventually 3.5. Her Coumadin was discontinued. She was\nrecommended to be discharged off Coumadin and follow up with her\nprimary care provider during the week following discharge to\nrecheck her INR and restart her Coumadin when it falls below 2.5.\nIn terms of ischemia , the patient had no acute evidence of\nischemia on presentation. Denied any chest pain and had no\nchanges consistent with ischemia on her EKG. She was continued\non aspirin and Lipitor throughout the admission.\n2. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency at\nbaseline. Her creatinine did increase from a baseline of 2.9 to\n3.2. During this admission , however , remained stable after that\npoint. She continued on renally-dosed medications and actually\nrequired repletion of both potassium and magnesium despite her\nrenal insufficiency throughout the admission in the setting of\naggressive diuresis. Her electrolytes were stable prior to\ndischarge home. She was followed by the LCH Renal Clinic with\nwhom she has had a previous conversations about the possibility\nof hemodialysis in the future and she will see them shortly after\nthis discharge:\n3. Pulmonary: The patient had dyspnea on exertion and bilateral\npleural effusions on her chest x-ray on admission. This was all\nfelt to be consistent with her heart failure. She did have no\nsigns or symptoms of any infectious etiology either on imaging or\nas a part of her clinical picture. Her dyspnea on exertion and\nher lung exam both improved with her aggressive diuresis.\n4. Endocrine: The patient had erratic fingersticks early in the\nadmission with a very low fingerstick blood glucoses in the\nmorning initially , so her p.m. Lantus dose was decreased from 18\nunits to 16 units and the NovoLog sliding scale was started.\nOn 0/12/2006 , she was noted to continue to have lower sugars in\nthe morning , but routinely elevated sugars in the afternoon\ngreater than 200. She was started on q.a.c. NovoLog regimen.\nHowever , on this regimen , she was found 1 morning to have a\nfingerstick blood glucose of 33 and to be hypothermic with a\ntemperature of 94 taken rectally. This was thought to be\nsecondary to hypoglycemia which may have progressed over several\nhours prior to assessment and her temperature returned to normal\nat 98 after her blood glucose was aggressively repleted. It was\nfelt that the patient likely had decreased metabolism of her\ninjected insulin in the setting of worsening renal failure , so ,\nher Lantus was decreased in accordance with a curbside\nconsultation with the diabetes management service. She will be\ndischarged home on a similar regimen to her home regimen simply\nwith a decreased Lantus dose down to 12 units nightly. She\nshould continue to monitor her fingerstick blood glucoses at\nhome. We were hesitant to change the types or timing of her\ninsulin during this hospitalization. I left that item to be\nfurther managed by her primary care provider after discharge:\n5. Hematologic: The patient has a chronic normocytic anemia\nfelt likely to be secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency.\nHer iron studies were rechecked on this admission and her iron\nstudies were also normal.

        "ASSESSMENT-13": "ASSESSMENT  In the emergency room , the patient was acutely treated\nfor presumed sepsis and received a dose of ceftriaxone\nand clindamycin. Urinalysis results indicated that she had a\npotential urinary tract infection at that time. Blood cultures\nwere drawn and the patient received IV hydration. Her EKG was\nnoted to have new T-wave inversions as compared to previously with\nan indeterminate troponin. She was admitted to medicine for\nmanagement.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-14": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient's hospital course can be summarized\nas follows:\n1. Cardiovascular: The patient has no known cardiac history. Her\ncardiac risk factors include cigarette smoking and postmenopausal\nfemale , age 51. No diabetes mellitus. No known\nhypercholesterolemia. No known family history. She does , however ,\ndrink heavily and has done so for a number of years. She has no\nknown cardiotoxic effect secondary to alcohol.\nThe T-wave inversions were noted with an indeterminate troponin.\nThe patient was admitted in a rule out protocol. She ruled out for\nan myocardial infarction with serial CKs which were all below 50.\nHer T-wave inversions persisted despite resolution of her sinus\ntachycardia. An echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated\ndilated left ventricle of 5.6 cm and an ejection fraction of 25 to\n30% with inferoseptal and inferoseptal apical akinesis. No\nventricular thrombus was noted.\nCardiology consultation service was asked to see the patient to\nevaluation her in the setting of her new depressed ejection\nfraction and focal wall motion abnormalities. Initially , she was\npresumed to have coronary disease which had been clinically silent\nprior to this. She was treated with aspirin , Lopressor and\nCaptopril 6.25 mg three times a day. Unfortunately , the patient's\nblood pressure did not tolerate this antihypotensive regimen and ,\ndespite efforts to scale it back in dosages , the majority of the\nmedicines were held. Nevertheless , the patient's heart rate slowed\nto the 60s. She experienced one episode of burning chest pain on\nthe night of admission which was alleved with Maalox. There were\nno EKG changes associated with that pain.\nThe patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on July\nThe cardiac catheterization was notable for a right atrial\npressure of 5. Right ventricular pressure of 36/10. Pulmonary\nartery pressure was 35/13 , and the pulmonary capillary wedge\npressure was 16. Her cardiac output was 6.13 with an index of\n3.69. The left heart catheterization noted normal coronary\narteries without evidence of significant coronary disease. Her\nleft ventriculogram also noted a preserved ejection fraction with\nno focal wall motion abnormalities. Dr. Garret Dalrymple of the\ncardiac consultation service followed the patient in house and felt\nthat the reversal of her wall motion abnormalities could be\nattributable to the acute effects of alcoholic cardiotoxicity. The\npatient will be discharged on aspirin for primary prevention of\ncoronary disease , as her other medications were discontinued. The\npatient was heparinized for her apical wall motion abnormality and\nlow ejection fraction while in house and the heparin was\ndiscontinued at the time of catheterization.\n2. GI: The patient presented with an acute elevation of her\ntransaminases. The patient's transaminases were noted to be less\nthan 10 in July of 1998. Initially , it was felt that these\ntransaminases might reflect alcoholic hepatitis given her\nsignificant alcohol history. The patient reports that her last\ndrink was on Sunday prior to admission. She drinks about a pint of\nbrandy every day. The patient's transaminases continued to rise ,\nhowever. The diagnosis of acute Tylenol toxicity superimposed upon\nhepatocellular damage from alcoholic hepatitis was also\nentertained. She was empirically started on naphthyl cystine and\nreceived approximately two to three doses , however , that medication\nwas discontinued upon GI consultation. The patient's transaminases\nrose to a level of approximately 4000 AST and 1000 ALT , and the GI\nservice was consulted. The patient's hepatitic serologies were\nsent and were notable for positive hepatitis B core antigen ,\nwhereas the rest of her hepatitis serologies including hepatitis C ,\nhepatitis A and hepatitis B surface antigen were negative. The GI\nservice felt that her hepatocellular injury was most likely\nattributable to an ischemic \"shock liver\" condition. She had a\nright upper quadrant ultrasound as well which demonstrated a\ndilatation of the common bile duct to 1 cm with some biliary\nsludging but no evidence of obstructive lesions. Given the\npatient's isolated increase in AST and ALT and bilirubin without an\nincrease in alkaline phosphatase , the diagnosis of ischemic\nhepatotoxicity was entertained by the GI service. On the date of\ndischarge , the patient's ALT had fallen to 221 and her AST had\nfallen to 50. Her total bilirubin had fallen to 1.1. The patient\nwas asymptomatic from hepatic perspective throughout her\nhospitalization without any evidence of encephalopathy or\nasterixis. An isolated ammonia level was sent and it was 45.\n3. Infectious disease: The patient had a repeat urinalysis that\nwas sent on the morning following admission which was indicative of\nurinary tract infection. Urine culture eventually indicated an\ninfection with Enterococcus. The patient received seven days of\nampicillin while in house , following her initial first day dosing\nof ceftriaxone and clindamycin. The patient's urinary tract\ninfection clear symptomatically. She developed a yeast infection\nin her vulvar area secondary to antibiotic therapy and this was\ntreated with topical Nystatin. The patient was not discharged on\nantibiotics as she clinically cleared her infection.\n4. FVN: The patient had persistent hypomagnesemia while in house\nand required significant magnesium repletion. The etiology of this\nhypomagnesemia was unclear; however , it was attributable to her\nchronic alcohol use and depletion of total magnesium stores. Her\nelectrolytes clearly need to be followed closely as an outpatient.\n5. Hematologic: The patient's INR slightly increased while in\nhouse but this is attributable to heparin bolus and\nsupratherapeutic prothrombin time. Upon discharge , the patient's\nINR had normalized. She received vitamin K 10 mg x 3 days as\nempiric treatment for vitamin K depletion secondary to chronic\nalcoholism as well as the possibility for hepatic synthetic\ndysfunction.\n6. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation for\nhypotension was attributable to dehydration; however , it became\nclear that the patient normally exists with a low normal blood\npressure of approximately 80 to 100 systolic. It was stressed to\nthe patient that she must maintain adequate p.o. intake to maintain\nher circulating blood volume , as she seemed to be intolerant to the\nantihypotensive medicines that were used for cardioprotection. A\nrandom cortisol was drawn and was normal. The issue of potential\nrenal insufficiency was most likely excluded. The patient will\nfollow-up on endocrine and electrolyte issues with her primary\ndoctor.",

        "HISTORY-3": "HISTORY  A 61-year-old female with a long tobacco\nhistory of COPD , and recently diagnosed\nsleep apnea is admitted with an asthma flare. In 1981 , she had a\nDVT which required IVC filter placement. In 1983 , she had a\nnonQ-wave MI and cath at that time showed an 80% proximal LAD\nstenosis , 30% RCA stenosis treated medically. In March of 1991 ,\nthe patient had an exercise test in which she went four minutes\nin 28 seconds , stopped because of fatigue and there were no\ndiagnostic EKG changes. PFT's at that time were reportedly\nnormal , although details are not available at this time.\nIn August of 1991 , further evaluation of the patient's dyspnea\nincluded multiple normal EKG's , a low probable VQ scan. She was\ntreated with steroids and inhalers ( Bronchosol ) with good relief.\nIn July 1991 , the patient had recurrent dyspnea on exertion. She\nruled out for an MI at Jeanes Medical Center . Repeat Cath\nshowed an LAD stenosis of 40% , RCA of 80% and an ejection\nfraction of 73%. She was discharged on medical management.\nIn February of 1991 , the patient was diagnosed with \"asthma\"/COPD\nand had another rule out MI for dyspnea. At that time , she had\nanother ETT in which she went four minutes and 45 seconds ,\nstopped secondary to chest pain , however , the EKG was\nnondiagnostic. Thallium showed fixed anterior defects ( although\nthe effects overlying breast tissue cannot be ruled out ).\nBronchoscopy showed mild bronchitis and , since that time , she was\ndischarged on a prednisone taper which had gradually been tapered\ndown to 11 mg a day.\nOf note , the patient also has been diagnosed with sleep apnea for\nwhich she is on nasal CPAP. She sleeps in a chair due to\northopnea and occasionally has paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.\nThe most recent pulmonary function tests ( March 1992 ) showed an\nFEV1 of 1.76 , an FVC of 2.5 , ratio of 70% , DLCO of 28.3. A\ntwenty-four holter was negative for arrhythmias. Exercise test\nat that time , she went nine minutes and had no ST changes.\nThallium images were again unremarkable.\nOne week prior to admission , the patient developed symptoms of\nupper respiratory infection including sneezing , rhinorrhea ,\nheadache and had increased shortness of breath. Steroids were\nincreased as were nebulizers with symptomatic improvement. Over\nthe five days prior to admission , the patient had increasing\nshortness of breath , wheezing worse at night. She denies fevers ,\nchills , sweats , nausea , vomiting , chest pain , abdominal pain ,\ncough , rash or joint pain.\nIn the Emergency Room , the patient was in marked respiratory\ndistress for which she was given nebulizer and begun on IV Solu-\nMedrol. Peak flow at that time was 180.\nPast medical history , COPD , coronary artery disease status post\nnonQ-wave MI 1983. Obesity. Sleep apnea. Allergic rhinitis.\nStatus post cholecystectomy.

She\nunderwent an esophageal acid study to rule out subclinical\naspiration ( results pending at the time of discharge ). There was\nno infectious component to her exacerbation detected , although\npreceding viral illness cannot be excluded. The patient was\ntreated with subcutaneous Heparin for DVT risks.\nOn hospital day number four , the patient was converted to\nPrednisone without complications. She had no episodes of chest\npain and there was no evidence for ischemic etiology.\nAt the time of discharge , the patient's peak flows were greater\nthan 500 and her lung exam had cleared remarkably. She is\ntransferred to Foflotroy Hospital for respiratory\nrehabilitation on the following medications: Aspirin one tablet\np.o. q.d.; Atrovent puffers two puffs q. 4 hours; Beconase nasal\ninhaler two puffs q. 6 hours; Heparin 10 , 000 units subcutaneous\nb.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg q. h.s.; Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. d.

The\npatient's idiopathic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 1990. The\npatient had a Chronicle device to monitor filling pressures\nplaced in 2001 , which has been nonfunctional since 2004. The\npatient had worsening symptoms in July 2004 , which led to an\nadmission for diuresis. She showed evidence of fluid overload on\nadmission of diuresis with IV Lasix and IV dobutamine. The\npatient developed a Chronicle device lead thrombus and was\nstarted on anticoagulation. The patient underwent a right heart\ncath in July 2004 , which showed an artery pressure of 10 , wedge\npressure of 25 , SVR 2074 , PVR 326 , and CI of 1.5. Post-diuresis\nafter addition of hydralazine and Isordil , the patient's RA\npressures were RA=8 , pulmonary artery=50/24 , cardiac index of 2.4\nwith SVR of 1205. The patient's most recent admission was in\nNovember 2004 with decompensated heart failure , during which time\nshe was diuresed with IV Lasix , metolazone , and dobutamine and\ndiuresed 11 liters. The patient also began workup for cardiac\ntransplant at that time. The patient on this admission describes\none week of abdominal distention , lower extremity edema , and\nstable two-pillow orthopnea. The patient describes no PND ,\nshortness of breath , or palpitations. She also denies dietary or\nmed noncompliance.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-10": "HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. Cardiovascular:\nIschemia: The patient has no known CAD. She had a troponin at\nadmission of 0.12 , which subsequently went down to 0.10 less than\nassay. It is thought to be secondary to right ventricular strain\nwith volume overload. The patient was initially started on\naspirin and a statin; however , given her no evidence of CAD and a\nnormal cholesterol panel , both aspirin and statin were\ndiscontinued.\nPump: The patient presented as \"cold and wet\" with poor forward\nflows secondary to systolic dysfunction and likely increased SVR.\nThe patient was started on dobutamine for improved inotrope.\nThe patient was also put on a Lasix strip for diuresis after a\nloading dose. The patient was maintained on Isordil and\nhydralazine for pre and afterload reduction. Her ACE inhibitor\nwas held while on the Lasix strip. Metolazone also was used to\nimprove diuresis , and the patient was maintained on digoxin with\nlevel checks every three days. The patient underwent an echo ,\nwhich showed an EF of 15% , global akinesis with\nmoderate-to-severe MR , moderate TR , and no evidence of\ndyssynchrony. The patient had moderate-to-severe RV dysfunction.\nRhythm: The patient was maintained on telemetry , especially\ngiven the fact that she had no ICD in place. EP was consulted\nand evaluated the patient for both an ICD and biventricular pacer\ngiven no evidence of dyssynchrony on echo , it was decided that\nthe patient would undergo ICD placement only.\n2. Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.1 on admission and was\nmonitored closely with diuresis. On admission , she had a normal\nUA.\n3. Heme: The patient was placed on heparin instead of Coumadin\nfor Chronicle device lead thrombus with a PTT goal of 60-80. The\npatient's platelets dropped from 222 to 166 during this admission\nand tests were ordered for the HIT antibody. The patient's\nplatelets normalized , but unfortunately , the PF4 was positive.\nIt was felt that this was a false positive and this was confirmed\nwith a Heme consult. Heme recommended rechecking the PF4 in\nthree to four weeks and holding heparin products until the PF4\nwas rechecked. The patient would be restarted on Coumadin after\nher ICD placement.\n4. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on sliding scale\ninsulin and Lantus for diabetes management.\n5. GI: The patient had right upper quadrant pain on admission\nlikely related to a congested liver. A right upper quadrant\nultrasound showed a normal liver with thickened gall bladder\nwalls and ascites , and her symptoms were improved with diuresis.\nThe patient was maintained on Nexium for prophylaxis.\n6. Psych: The patient was continued on citalopram and Ativan\nfor depression and anxiety. Psych was consulted for assistance\nwith management.\n7. Musculoskeletal: The patient was maintained on probenecid\nfor gout.\n8. Prophylaxis: The patient was on PPI and heparin until she\nwas on the HIT positive and was placed on Pneumoboots for\nprophylaxis.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive\nCare Unit for further treatment evaluation of his\nsevere metabolic abnormalities. He also by labs he had a\nsignificant severe pancreatitis and was felt to be either a DKA or\nHHNKA. An endocrine consult was obtained and they felt that the\npatient was likely not in DKA as the patient's level of\nbetahydroxybutyrate of 1.66 was not enought to explain the\npatient's gap or all his metabolic disturbances. The endocrine\nservice that more likely the patient had hyperglycemic ,\nhyperosmolar , nonketotic acidosis and also severe pancreatitis.\nInitial screens for the cause of pancreatitis were negative\nincluding stones. The patient has significant alcohol history and\nhas been drinking alcohol which is the most likely cause of his\nsevere pancreatic insufficiency. The patient was aggressively\nhydrated with IV fluids and his metabolic abnormalities began to\ncorrect. He was also noted by labs to be in acute renal failure\nand a renal consult was obtained. The patient's nonoliguric renal\nfailure was in the setting of severe dehydration secondary to\nhyperosmolar state and ACE inhibitors were felt most likely due to\nATN. A renal ultrasound performed on 12 of January showed no evidence of\ngallstones or biliary duct dilatation.\nAn abdominal CT performed on 20 of February showed grade I pancreatitis with\nno evidence of a pseudocyst. The patient's clinical course was\ncomplicated by rhabdomyolysis which was felt to be due to a\nhypophosphatemic state , but this was not completely clear as the\npatient's CKs began to rise while the patient's phosphate was still\nsecondary to the acute renal failure. The patient's CKs peaked\naround 10 , 000 and then began to fall steadily and the patient's\nrenal function with continued hydration improved steadily as his\ncreatinine and BUN returned to normal. However , in the night of\n20 of September the patient's abdominal pain worsened and there was a\nquestion of peritoneal signs which prompted an emergent exploratory\nlaparotomy to rule out abdominal ischemia. However , the findings\nwere not consistent with ischemic bowel , but only severe\npancreatitis was noted. On 13 of September and 20 of September the patient did very well\npostoperatively back in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. He was\nstarted on TPN and with a slow wean of his of dextrose , his blood\nsugars normalized. On 20 of September the patient's renal function had also\nnormalized. The patient by 24 of November had marked decreased abdominal\npain , normalized electrolytes and his renal function was at his\nbaseline with a creatinine of 1.0.\nThe patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nto our service on 21 of April on TPN and the following medications:\n1. Digoxin 0.375 mg q.d.\n2. Carafate one gram b.i.d.\n3. Albuterol two puffs t.i.d.\n4. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.\nHe is also on TPN , but was being advanced to a clear liquid diet\nand seemed to be tolerating it well. He also continued to require\na large amount of insulin through his TPN and also through his\nsliding scale. The patient did well and was able to tolerate a\nclear liquid diet and was advanced in the next two days to a soft ,\nsolid diet with very low fat.\nI will dictate the rest of the patient's events , assessment and\nplan by problem list as follows:\n1. GI:\nI. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient was able to be advanced\nto a soft solid diet for the past few days. She has abdominal pain\nwhich had almost resolved and then resumed and the patient\ndeveloped a watery diarrhea. It was felt that this could be due to\npancreatic insufficiency versus C. diff colitis and therefore C.\ndiff samples were sent and the patient was presumptively started on\nFlagyl and Pancrease 12 , 000 units t.i.d. 1/2 hour before meals.\nThe patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea persisted. This prompted\nus to make the patient n.p.o. once more and another abdominal CT\nwas obtained. An abdominal CT performed on 9 of August showed\nprogression of pancreatitis with increase inflammatory changes.\nThere was no necrosis or pseudocyst formation noted. Also noted\nwas some significant small bowel dilatation without any evidence of\nobstruction. Therefore , the patient was continued to be kept\nn.p.o. and TPN was restarted on 9 of January .  The patient has tolerated\nthis well and at this time has no longer had any abdominal pain\neither subjectively or on exam. It does occasionally have mild low\nback pain which is thought to actually be due to his pancreatitis\nas opposed to any musculoskeletal cause.\nII. DIARRHEA: The patient also had diarrhea as noted above.\nHe has been worked up extensively. His diarrhea has now resolved.\nHe was C. diff negative , but was treated presumptively with Flagyl\nfor seven days. All stool studies including Shigella , Salmonella ,\nCampylobacter , ova and parasites , Microsporidia have been negative.\nHis stool has been sent for quantitative fecal fast which is still\npending on discharge. He has been repeatedly guaiac negative. As\nnoted above his diarrhea has resolved.\nIII. RESOLVED HEME POSITIVITY: The patient earlier in the\ncourse of his Intensive Care Unit stay had some stools that were\nheme positive. They were thought to be due to gastritis. He has\nnow been on initially , after that has been on Prilosec and now\nchanged over to ranitidine in his TPN and has had multiple guaiac\nnegative stools in the past ten days.\nIV. SMALL PERIANAL ULCER: The patient was noted to have a\nsmall perianal ulcer. It is felt to be secondary to pressure from\nlying in bed and also secondary to his multiple episodes of\ndiarrhea which had been going on for days. It is felt that this\nshould resolve. If it does not , it is suggested that the ulcer be\nswabbed and sent for HSV.\n2. ENDOCRINE:\nI. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS: Due to the patient's\npancreatic insufficiency , the patient will be a life long diabetic.\nThe patient has been followed by the endocrine service and is now\nreceiving 45 units of insulin per liter through his TPN. He is\nalso on a sliding scale regular regimen with finger stick q6h. It\nis felt that this should be a relatively stable regimen for him at\nthis time. As the patient is weaned off his TPN and starts to take\np.o. again , he should be switched over to NPH b.i.d. with regular\ninsulin checks on a sliding scale before his meals. The patient\nalso has a follow-up appointment with the diabetes clinic in three\nweeks as noted below.\n3. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient does have a history of congestive\nheart failure and has had mild bi-basilar crackles throughout his\nstay here. This has not limited him in any way. He has had a good\noxygen saturations. The patient continues to take 40 mg of Lasix\np.o. q.d. On the day of discharge , he received an extra 20 mg IV\nas he has been I&amp;Os positive for the last few days and we noted a\nslightly more crackles on his exam. Of note , the patient has a\nlong history of having paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but had been\ndoing relatively well here. His current medical regimen includes\nIsordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. Both of\nthese can be titrated upwards as his blood pressure allows. He has\nhad some labile blood pressures ranging anywhere from the systolics\nof 80s to 130s while in the hospital and he has never been\nsymptomatic and even when he has been , he has had blood pressures\nin the 80s and has tolerated this well. He is also maintained on\ndigoxin 0.375 mg q.d. He is also taking aspirin for his cardiac\nregimen.\n4. PULMONARY: The patient had good O2 saturations and usually\nranging from 95 to 97% on room air and has had no pulmonary\nproblems. He has had bibasilar crackles on exam which is felt to\nbe due to some mild congestive heart failure for which he is taking\nLasix. He may need some extra doses of Lasix per your directions\nthe next few days.\n5. HEME: The patient's hematocrit has been low in the high 20s on\ntwo occasions. In both cases always drifting down slowly thought\nto be due to delutional effects plus repeat a phlebotomy. He has\nbeen transfused a total of three units while he has been in the\nhospital here. Otherwise is hematocrit has been stable for\nmultiple days so has his platelets. Also of note the patient has\nbeen heme negative from below for more than ten days.\n6. RENAL: The patient says his baseline creatinine in which his\nacute renal failure has resolved.\n7. RHABDOMYOLYSIS: This has also resolved with the patient's CKs\nhaving normalized over a week ago.\n8. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient has remained afebrile , normal\nwhite count for many days. While here he was also presumptively\ntreated for C. diff which was actually found to be negative on his\nstool examinations with no fecal leukocytes. The patient's\ntemperature curve should be followed given that the patient\ncontinues to have pancreatitis and is at risk for developing a\nphlegmon.",
        "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN-12": "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN \n1. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient continues to be on TPN. A\nPICC line has been placed and a triple lumen catheter will be\nremoved prior to transfer of the patient. It is our feeling that\nthe patient should remain on TPN for the next two days and then as\nper your directions , the patient could be slowly advanced on a p.o.\ndiet as tolerated. We feel that the patient deserves another trial\nto see if he can tolerate p.o. before any long term decisions is\nmade regarding his nutrition and perhaps placement of a J-tube for\nlong term feeding. The patient's amylase and lipase on the day of\ndischarge are 47 for amylase and 166 for lipase. These values\ncontinue to remain low even when the patient was having abdominal\npain. This is felt to be due to a relatively burnt out pancreas.\nA GI consult was also obtained which agrees with this assessment.\nIt is felt that when the patient does start taking p.o. again he\nshould have pancreas at least 8 to 12 , 000 units t.i.d. half hour\nbefore meals due to his pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Also\nthe patient should be followed clinically very closely including\nhis white count , fever curve and his abdominal exam for any signs\nand symptoms of development of an infection or phlegmon or\npseudocyst because of his pancreatitis. The patient's TPN should\nbe continued as noted below.\n2. ENDOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY: The patient , as noted above , will\nrequire insulin , both through is TPN and his fingersticks should be\nchecked every six hours. As noted when the patient is switched\nover to a p.o. regimen , we suggest per endocrine recommendations\nthat NPH be given b.i.d. and the patient should be covered with an\ninsulin sliding scale at bedtime.\nThe patient is being transferred to Redist Nalereamer Memorial Hospital on\n25 of August in good condition. The patient today denies any abdominal\npain , nausea or vomiting , but occasionally continues to have mild\nback pain. His diarrhea has resolved. He is afebrile with a blood\npressure of 120/70 , pulse is 69 , respiratory rate 16 , sat 97 on\nroom air , with a weight of 69.0 kg. He is comfortable and has had\nbibasilar crackles of 1/4 the way up. His abdomen is soft ,\nnontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds. His\nextremities are without edema.\nOn the day of discharge his white count is 8.8 , hematocrit is 36 ,\nADDplatelets of 348. His SMA-7 was within normal limits with a\ncreatinine of 0.6.

The patient tolerated this\nprocedure well. Postoperatively , her hospital course went as\nfollows by systems: 1 ) NEUROLOGIC-The patient continued to have\nsome degree of pain that was noted on weight bearing of the lateral\naspect of the right thigh but not progressing much further beyond\nthat towards the foot as it had preoperatively. The intensity of\nthis pain was also somewhat less than it was preoperatively. There\nwere no significant symptoms on the left. She also had the expected\nsurgical pain. 2 ) RESPIRATORY-There were no significant issues.\nThe patient did have the history of mild childhood asthma and\nperioperatively she did demonstrate some end expiratory wheezes\nthat were treated with Ventolin and Albertol inhaler treatents.\nThese were resolved by the time of discharge. Her O2 saturations\nwere well maintained throughout her hospital stay. 3 )\nCARDIAC-There were no significant issues. 4 ) GI/NUTRITIONAL-The\npatient had no significant problems. She had a bowel movement\nprior to discharge. Her diet was advanced without difficulty.\n5 ) RENAL/ELECTROLYTE-The patient was able to void when her Foley\nwas discontinued on postoperative day 4. Electrolytes were followed\nand treated on prn basis. 6 ) HEMOLOGIC-The patient required\ntransfusion of her 1 unit of autologous blood. Subsequently , with\nthe patient on Iron Gluconate and Colace , her hematocrit came from\n25 after her unit of blood up to 29.1 on her last check prior to\ndischarge. She will be on iron for 1 month postoperatively. The\npatient was maintained on compression boots postoperatively until\nshe was up and walking more independently. 7 ) INFECTIOUS\nDISEASE-There were no significant itssues. 8 ) ORTHOPEDIC-Her\nwound showed excellent signs of healing postoperatively. There was\nno evidence of infection at any time and her flaps looked viable at\nall times. Her postoperative neurologic status was as described\nabove. The patient was given an Orthomol brace which she is to\nwear at all times whenever out of bed.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-8": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was taken to the operating room on\nMarch , by Dr. Jenovese , who initially opened the\nright lower quadrant to explore for appendicitis. In exploring the\nabdomen , purulent material was found in the right lower quadrant ,\nand the appendix was not able to be visualized. The decision was\nmade to open the midline incision which was done. Details of the\noperation may be found in Dr. Zinsli 's operative report. By\nreport , she had gangrenous portions of the right colon ,\nnecessitating a right colectomy. This was performed , and she\ntolerated the procedure well and was transferred extubated in\nstable condition to the floor. Her immediate postoperative course\nwas complicated by supraventricular tachycardia to a rate of 200\nwith hypotension , requiring beta blockade and adenosine. She was\ntransferred to the Surgical ICU for further management. After the\nuse of beta blockade and adenosine , her arrhythmia resolved. This\nwas found to occur with magnesium of 1.5 which was repleted. Per\nrecommendations of the Cardiology Service , an echocardiogram was\nobtained which was normal , and she ruled out for myocardial\ninfarction by serial CKs and electrocardiograms. An NG tube was in\nplace which was continued on the first postoperative day , and she\nwas kept on Zantac. She was kept on ampicillin , levofloxacin and\nFlagyl. A central line was in place. Over the next few\npostoperative days , as her NG tube was removed and her diet slowly\nadvanced with sips , she was converted to p.o. medication. At one\npoint she developed a second episode of supraventricular\ntachycardia and was thought to be either atrial fibrillation versus\nsinus tachycardia. This did not respond immediately to Lopressor\nand per Cardiology's recommendations , she was changed to diltiazem\nfollowed by Diltiazem drip. When stabilized , her dose of Lopressor\nwas increased , Diltiazem stopped and she was converted to p.o.\nLopressor 50 t.i.d. which kept her in sinus rhythm and a stable\nrate. By the third and fourth postoperative day , she was\ntolerating a regular diet , passing flatus and bowel movements and\nambulating independently. She was weaned off her oxygen and her\ncentral line was discontinued. She was stable for discharge.\nThe patient was discharged to home on November , 2000. At that time\nshe will have completed a 5-day course of ampicillin , levofloxacin\nand Flagyl. She is tolerating a regular diet , ambulating\ndependently and requiring minimal amounts of oral analgesics.

Her last hemodialysis session was two days\nprior to admission , and she is usually dialyzed on Mondays ,\nWednesdays and Fridays. Interventional radiology did not perform\na thrombectomy of the right upper extremity fistula clot , as the\npatient's systolic blood pressures were in the 90s , and they were\nconcerned about the patient's change in mental status as she\nwould need conscious sedation for the procedure. She was also\nnoted upon admission to have an EKG that displayed an atrial\ntachyarrhythmia with 2:1 block that was presumed to be atrial\nflutter. Her heart rate was noted to be in the 110s to 120s , and\nthe rest of her vital signs were stable. The patient denied any\nchest pain , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , or\npalpitations. It should be noted however that the patient was\nnot entirely conversant. After speaking with the patient's son ,\nmore information was obtained about this patient's subacute\nchange in her mental status. The patient was admitted in August\nof 2004 for a fall and femur fracture. During that admission ,\nthe son stated that the patient had an acute change in her mental\nstatus such that she did not know who she was or where she was.\nShe was not answering questions appropriately. This was\npersistent during that hospital stay and was of unclear etiology.\nPrior to that admission , the patient is at baseline oriented to\nperson , place and time , and she is also very conversant. The son\ndoes admit that the patient occasionally becomes confused about\nthe day of the week. Upon discharge from that admission , the\npatient was sent to the Adtute Hospital for rehabilitation. The\nson says that over the last few months , she has become slightly\nbetter but definitely not at her baseline. He states that she is\noften disoriented to person and place , although she does answer\nsome questions appropriately. The day prior to her admission ,\nthe patient's other son visit with her at the Meretcan Hospital Of County and\ndid not notice any change in her mental status since her\ndischarge. He has noted decreased p.o. intake over the last\nmonth with the patient often refusing to eat.

Cardiovascular:\nA. Pump: The patient is status post cardiac transplant and has\nbeen maintained on her outpatient immunosuppressive regimen.\nThis includes prednisone , rapamycin , and Imuran. She has\nremained euvolemic during her hospital admission.\nB. Ischemia: There were no active issues , and the patient was\nmaintained on her outpatient regimen of aspirin , statin and\nImdur.\nC. Rhythm: Electrophysiology has been seeing the patient and\nhas recommended medical management for her atrial flutter/atrial\nfibrillation with 2:1 block. The patient's heart rate ranged\nfrom the 80s to 120s , and she was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o.\nq.i.d. She seemed to respond well to the diltiazem , although it\nwas hard to measure a response since the patient often refused\nher medications. The patient was also maintained on metoprolol\n75 mg p.o. q.i.d. It was hoped that the addition of the\ndiltiazem to the metoprolol would allow for the rate control of\nthis patient's atrial arrhythmia.\n2. Renal: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease\non hemodialysis. A tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed on\n2/12/04 for temporary access for hemodialysis. She was dialyzed\nwhile in the hospital and maintained on Nephrocaps. She is\nscheduled on 8/2/04 for a right upper extremity venogram in\norder to access her anatomy for the vascular surgeons to create\nhemodialysis access.\n3. Neurology/psychiatry: The patient's change in mental status\nover the last few months is still of an unclear etiology. She\nunderwent an EEG that showed diffuse slowing that was consistent\nwith a toxic metabolic etiology. There was no seizure activity.\nShe underwent two CT scans of her head without contrast that were\nnegative for bleed. There were no changes in her CT scans when\ncompared to prior CT scan. She also underwent an LP with CSF as\nmentioned above. An MRI was not completed as the patient has an\nevent monitor in her heart. The differential diagnosis for this\npatient is changed and her mental status still includes\ndepression and pseudodementia , and we are still ruling out\ninfectious etiologies with the CSF studies that are pending at\nthe moment ( although this is unlikely ). It is hoped that she\nwill be able to follow up with neuropsychiatric testing in order\nto further evaluate her change in mental status. It should be\nnoted that during her hospital stay , the patient's level of\ninteraction with the staff varied. There were days where she was\nmore conversant and would answer many questions appropriately.\nThere were also times when the patient refused to speak with\nstaff , appeared withdrawn and refused medications and treatments.\nThe son has noted that she was actually better in the hospital ,\nappearing more conversant and interactive. It does not appear\nthat these periods of increased interaction with staff and family\nwere in any correlation with this patient's hemodialysis.\n4. Endocrinology: The patient has type 2 diabetes on insulin at\nhome. She was maintained on a sliding scale of lispro with\nfingersticks blood glucose before every meal and before sleeping.\nHer blood sugars were in control and ranged between 110 to 240.\n5. Infectious diseases: The patient has had a few low-grade\ntemperatures to the 100.0. An infectious workup did not yield\nany etiology. She has not had an elevation in her white blood\ncell count , although this may be a result of her\nimmunosuppression. Blood cultures from 6/19/04 yielded no\ngrowth. Urine was not cultured , as the patient is anuric.\n6. Feeding and electrolytes: The patient was hypercalcemic on\nadmission. This was attributed to vitamin D per the renal\nfellow. Her calcium levels were followed and trended into the\nnormal range. She was fed a pureed and honey thick diet after\nher speech and swallow evaluation indicated that the patient had\nintact swallowing function.\n7. GI: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease , and\nshe was given Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.day.",

        "IMPRESSION-11": "IMPRESSION \nThe patient was evaluated to be low likelihood for having\npneumonia. She was thought to more likely have volume overload\nsecondary to CHF. Because of her visual problems and declining\nphysical condition and deconditioning , patient's current living\nsituation and arrangements are possibly insufficient for her\nincreasing needs and error in self administration of medications\nor increasing renal insufficiency or poor p.o. intake may have\nprecipitated her hypoglycemic episode and altered mental status.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE \nID/Pulmonary: Right lower lobe pneumonia versus CHF , pleural\neffusion. This was treated initially with levofloxacin although\nit is unlikely consolidated lobar pneumonia because of the\npatient's good clinical status , lack of fever and white count and\nlack of toxicity. Sputum culture and gram stein were\nunremarkable. Pleural effusion on the right decreased only\nminimally with diuresis of 1 to 2 liters overnight and for\ndiagnostic and therapeutic purposes , the patient underwent a\nthoracentesis on 2/11/05 and had withdraw 800 cc of clear yellow\nfluid whose chemistries and cell count were consistent with a\nsterile transudative effusion. Gram stein was negative.\nCultures are pending at this time and a chest x-ray may be\nrepeated to rule out underlying pneumonia revealed by draining of\nthe effusion. Urine legionella was negative.\nRenal: Chronic renal insufficiency. Creatinine is at a baseline\nof 2.6 and it decreased significantly on this admission possibly\nbecause of improved forward flow from discontinuation of her ACE\ninhibitor.\nEndocrinology: The patient was admitted with hypoglycemic\ndiabetes possibly secondary to infection or logistical and social\nbarriers. Her NPH dose was cut to 20 units subcu. q.d. with\nlispro sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s. which she needed only\nminimally about 5 units a day and her sugars were well controlled\non this regimen which supports the hypothesis that her NPH dose\nof 34 units a day was too high beyond a certain point.\nCardiac:\nA. Pump: The patient with CHF , known valvular dysfunction ,\nexhibiting pulmonary edema , lower extremity edema and orthopnea.\nShe was initially diuresed with IV Lasix and it was noted that\nher weight was up 10 pounds from her prior admission. She was\ntransitioned to p.o. Lasix after diuresing very well on this\nregimen. She continued her Lipitor and aspirin , atenolol was\nchanged metoprolol given her renal insufficiency. Lisinopril was\nswitched to captopril , then discontinued given her bumping\ncreatinine while diuresing on the ACE inhibitor. She was\nslightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 90s to\n100s at one point and responded to a bolus of fluid , decrease in\nthe captopril and holding the Lasix , unclear etiology , looks\notherwise low. Lasix was decreased to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and the\npatient should have daily weights and electrolytes checked and\nrepleted to ensure that her diuresis is only moderate everyday no\nmore than one liter a day but is consistent such that she is able\nto maintain her electrolytes and loose fluid overtime.\nHeme: The patient has a monoclonal gammopathy and a microcytosis\nwhich might suggest thalassemia. She is on iron and Epogen with\nan improved hematocrit from the prior admission but no change in\nher MCV , which suggests that she has more than renal disease\ncausing her microcytosis. Further workup of her monoclonal\ngammopathy will be deferred to her primary care physician.\nDiabetic diet: Low sodium , low fat , low cholesterol.\nProphylaxis: Heparin and H2 blocker.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM \n1 ) ID-Given his presentation of L lower leg swelling and\nerythema , Mr. Bock was started on Vancomycin and Unasyn in the\nemergency department. An X-ray of his L foot revealed significant\nfragmentation and erosion of the tarsal/metatarsal bases and\nfocal soft tissue abnormality in the plantar region concerning\nfor abscess formation and possible osteomyelitis in the setting\nof known Charcot arthropathy as well as diffuse soft tissue\nswelling extending along the calf. Given these findings , he was\nordered for an MRI. With his MRI pending and his L leg looking\nsomewhat improved , his Unasyn was discontinued on HD 3 and he was\nstarted on Augmentin and his Vancomycin was continued given his\nhistory of MRSA cellulitis in the past. He spiked a fever on HD 3\nand again on HD 4. On HD 5 , he had an MRI under conscious\nsedation ( was attempted prior to this , but pt unable to\ntolerate ). MRI revealed 4 cm fluid pocket in the subcutaneous\ntissue of the plantar aspect of the left foot demonstrating\ncommunication with the medial tendon sheaths and the ankle joint\nwith findings worrisome for abscess and osteomyelitis of at least\nthe medial malleolus , calcaneus , cuboid and talus. Infectious\ndisease was consulted and he was started on IV Levofloxacin and\nIV Flagyl to cover gram negatives and anaerobes respectively and\nhis vancomycin continued to be dosed for level less than 20.\nOrthopedics was consulted who performed an arthrocentesis of his\nankle as well as an arthrocentesis of the fluid collection at the\nbottom of his foot. Ankle aspirate gram stain was negative , but\nwith 4+ polys. Fluid differential revealed &gt;160 , 000 WBCs. In\nconsultation with infectious disease , orthopedics , and the\npatient , it was decided that the best course of action would be a\nL below knee amputation given the extent of the infection. This\nwas performed on HD 8 by Dr. Miears He did have fever spikes\nagain on HD 8-9 and had repeat blood cultures which were\nnegative. An echocardiogram was performed on HD 12. While he did\nhave a tiny focal thickening of the aortic cusp , this was\nreviewed with Cardiology and infectious disease and was not\nthough to represent a vegetation. He was afebrile x &gt;48 hours\nprior to discharge. His surgical pathology returned with clean\nmargins on day of discharge , and as per ID consult service , he\ndoes not need further antibiotics. He should have dry sterile\ndressing changes to his residual limb daily. He may need an extra\ndose of pain medication prior to this. If there is any evidence\nof erythema or drainage , Dr. Fuller 's office should be\ncontacted at 107-374-2467.\n2 ) Renal-Mr. Merriweather was on the renal service and had hemodialysis\n3 times a week ( M/W/F ) without complication. Of note , he is\nawaiting kidney transplant from his sister and is followed by Dr.\nFelix Zelle at NNH .\n3 ) Heme-Mr Vaeth was on coumadin as an outpatient. We obtained\nhis hospital records from NUOM and a vascular study from 6/25\nshowed evidence of a DVT in the L internal jugular vein from\n11/26 The details surrounding this DVT are not documented ,\nhowever Mr. Tirona reports that his vascular surgeon told him\nthat he should remain on Coumadin. His coumadin was held prior to\ngoing to the OR and he was placed on a heparin drip. His coumadin\nwas restarted after his BKA and he was bridged with heparin with\na goal PTT of 60-80. Prior to discharge , he PTT was 103 and his\nheparin drip was decreased from 2100 to 1950units per hours. He\nshould have a repeat PTT checked on transfer to his acute\nrehabilitation center with goal PTT 60-80. INR on day of\ndischarge was 1.8 , 1.6 day prior to discharge. His heparin drip\ncan be discontinued once his INR is therapeutic with goal of 2-3.\nHis INR will need to be followed every 2-3 days until stable off\nof levofloxacin.\n4 ) CV\nIschemia-Mr Grana was on gemfibrozil 600mg bid and lipitor 80mg\nas an outpatient. His lipid panel was checked: TC 140 , TG 151 ,\nLDL 82 , HDL 28. Given that his LDL was 82 and the risk of\nrhabdomylosis on high dose gemfibrozil and lipitor , his lipitor\nwas decreased to 20mg. He should have a repeat lipid panel in 4-6\nweeks. He was also started on low dose b-blocker to reduce\nperioperative MI risk prior to his surgery. He reported that he\nis not on aspirin given that he has had b/l vitrectomies and his\ndoctor felt that the risk of bleeding was too high. This can be\nreaddressed as an outpatient.\nPump-Pt had elevated systolic blood pressures to the 160s in the\nbeginning of his stay. He was started on lisinopril which was\nuptitrated to 5mg and also lopressor.\nRhtyhm-He had no evidence of arrythmias.\n5 ) Endocrine-Mr. Rovella has DM which was diagnosed at age 23. It\nis unclear if he has type I or II as he reported that he was told\nhe has Type I , but had a three year stint after diagnosis where\nhe was not on insulin. His FS on admission were elevated , likely\nsecondary to his infection and his lantus was uptitrated. He was\nalso started on prandial coverage. Prior to discharge , he was his\nhome dose of Lantus as well as Aspart with meals. He reported\nthat he already has an outpatient endocrinologist with whom he\nwill follow up. An HgA1c was 8.4.\n6 ) Pain-Mr. Vanhee had significant post operative pain which\nseemed to be mostly phantom limb pain. The acute pain service was\nconsulted and he was initially placed on a ketamine drip and\nFentanyl PCA. His fentanyl PCA and ketamine drip were\ndiscontinued and he was started on oxycontin 80mg tid with\noxycodone for breakthrough pain. He was also started on Lyrica\nfor neuropathic pain. He was comfortable prior to discharge on\nthis current regimen. As his pain improves , he pain regimen\nshould be decreased.\n7 ) Psychiatry-After learning that he would likely receive a\ntransplant from his sister , Mr. Potvin reports that he has had\nsignificant anxiety prior to going for dialysis. Psychiatry\nservice was consulted who recommended low dose Ativan prior to\nhim going to dialysis.",

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-3": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 66-year-old male\nwho was being worked up for other surgery and during preoperative\ntesting he was noted to have an abnormal EKG. This prompted a\ncardiac stress test , which was abnormal. He therefore received\nadditional cardiac workup and was found to have coronary artery\ndisease. He does have a history of atrial fibrillation in the\npast , but reports that he has not had any symptoms prior to his\ninitially planned shoulder surgery. He therefore presented for\nCABG rather than having shoulder surgery.",

There was right\ndominant circulation and 75%-80% right renal artery stenosis. He\nhad an ejection fraction of approximately 60%.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted to hospital on\n8/3/04 and was taken to the operating room on 4/15/04 where he\nreceived a five-vessel CABG in which the left internal mammary\nartery was sewn to the LAD. Saphenous vein graft 1 to first\ndiagonal artery. Right internal mammary artery was sewn to the\nramus. The left radial artery was harvested and sewn to LVB2 and\nLVB1. Bypass time was 159 minutes. Cross clamp time 111\nminutes. Postoperatively , he was taken to the cardiac intensive\ncare unit where he was hemodynamically stable. He was rapidly\nweaned of the ventilator without problems. He did develop a bout\nof rapid atrial fibrillation in the first two days\npostoperatively. This was treated by restarting the patient's\npropafenone , which he was taken preoperatively for atrial\nfibrillation. The patient's other primary issue postoperatively\nwhile in the intensive care unit was an episode of oliguria , near\nanuria. A renal consult was obtained at this time. He did\nreceive a bilateral renal ultrasound , which showed kidneys to be\nessentially equal in size with no hydronephrosis. He was started\non low-dose dopamine and once his systolic pressure went back to\nhis baseline preoperative systolic pressure of approximately 160 ,\nhe began to make adequate amounts of urine. It was therefore\ndetermined that his renal perfusion is largely pressure dependent\nwith him requiring a mean pressure of close to 100. He remained\nhemodynamically stable. He did have some constipation , which was\ntreated with an aggressive bowel regimen and subsequently\nresolved. He will be transferred out to the cardiac step-down\nunit on 11/24/04.\nThe remainder of this discharge summary will be dictated at the\ntime of discharge.\neScription document: 4-7746980 ISSten Tel\nDictated By: KONYE , JORGE\nAttending: MAGG , RANDY CAREY\nDictation ID 1979111",

His heart rate was\n62 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 170/72. His\noxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. He was awake and alert\nand in no acute distress. His jugular venous pressure was\napproximately 12 cm of water. His heart had a regular rate and\nrhythm with normal S1 and S2 and a systolic murmur at the left\nupper sternal border. He did not have any signs of pulses\nparadoxes. His lungs had decreased breath sounds at the right\nbase with rales at the left base. His abdomen was soft and\ndistended but nontender. There were normoactive bowel sounds.\nThe extremities had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally at the shins.\nHis neurologic exam was nonfocal.",
        "LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION-9": "LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION \nHis sodium was 134 and his potassium was 3.4. His chloride was\n100 and his bicarb was 21.

His EKG showed\nnormal sinus rhythm at the rate of 61 beats per minute. This was\na paced rhythm. His chest x-ray showed volume overload and\ncardiomegaly.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-10": "HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. Renal: On admission , Mr. Muraski had significant volume\noverload with weight gain , edema , and chest x-ray evidence of\npulmonary edema. He also had significant azotemia with a BUN of\n140. His creatinine had also increased from his baseline\ncreatinine of 5.0 to 7.0 at admission. His physical examination\nthe morning after admission showed worsening somnolence and slow\nasterixis with jerky myoclonic movements. On 10/3/05 , the\ntunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed in his right internal\njugular vein by interventional radiology. This procedure was\ntolerated without complication. Mr. Stahlnecker had his first run of\nhemodialysis on 6/15/05 , which he tolerated well with subsequent\nimprovement in his mental status and resolution of his asterixis.\nHe again underwent hemodialysis on 7/7/05 , 8/5/05 and\n0/28/05. In addition , he underwent a two-hour run of\nultrafiltration on 7/28/05 with removal of nearly four liters of\nfluid. Mr. Lavergne will continue with intermittent hemodialysis\non a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday schedule after discharge from\nBelllit Community Hospital . Plans are underway for Mr. Schroeppel\nto have an AV fistula placed. He has a follow-up appointment on\n9/15/05 with vascular surgery at F.shands Ieldmormode Hospital .\n2. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: Mr. Grassman was maintained\non a renal diet. He was started on Nephrocaps multivitamin. On\n6/15/05 , he was started on Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. for a phosphorus\nlevel of 5.8. However , on 7/28/05 , his phosphorus level was 1.8\nand therefore his Phoslo was held.\n3. Cardiovascular: Mr. Wallau has a long history of\nhypertension and he is treated with multiple medications. His\nsystolic blood pressures have ranged in the 160-180s during this\nadmission. He was continued on his Norvasc and labetolol. He\nwas also continued on hydralazine at 100 mg t.i.d. In addition ,\nlisinopril was added and titrated to 10 mg p.o. daily. In\naddition , he was continued on his clonidine at 0.6 mg b.i.d. Mr.\nBacus blood pressure did not return to a normal level after he\nwas dialyzed repeatedly. His blood pressure will need to be\ncontinued to be monitored at rehab with potentially additional\nmedicines added. In addition , Mr. Mok has a history of\ncoronary artery disease with recent non-ST elevation MI. He was\ninitially due to be discharged on 8/5/05 , but shortly after\nhemodialysis , he had one 15-minute episode of sharp left-sided\nchest pain. He was therefore ruled out for myocardial infarction\nwith serial enzymes and EKGs. He showed no evidence of\nmyocardial infarction.\n4. Hematology: Mr. Buetti is maintained on Coumadin for history\nof deep venous thrombosis. When he was first admitted , his\nCoumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneled\nhemodialysis catheter. He received one oral dose of vitamin K as\nwell as fresh frozen plasma prior to placement of the line. He\nwas subsequently restarted on his Coumadin and it was titrated\nwhile being treated with antibiotics. His previous dose was 4 mg\nand he will be discharged on that dose.\n5. Endocrine: Mr. Woodburn has a history of diabetes mellitus and\nwas maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.\n6. Infectious Disease: Mr. Goodyear became febrile to 101 degrees\nFahrenheit on 2/12/05. He was again febrile on 0/28/05. His\nurine culture grew out enterobacter cloacae , which was\nsubsequently found to be pan resistant. Prior to his\nsensitivities being obtained , he was treated with levofloxacin.\nWhen it was determined that the enterobacter was resistant to\nlevofloxacin , he was switched to gentamicin 60 mg IV x1 on\n4/17/05. He should receive several additional days of\ngentamicin approximately five or six days. He should be dosed\nafter hemodialysis for a gentamicin level less than 5. Mr.\nMontogomery did have one positive blood culture from 3/6/05 that\ngrew out gram-positive cocci in clusters at the time of this\ndictation. There was only one out of four bottles that grew out\nthese gram-positive cocci. He did receive one dose of vancomycin\nin the early morning of 4/17/05. It was felt that this blood\nculture most likely represented a contaminant. All of his other\nblood cultures remained negative at the time of this dictation.",

Cardiovascular:\nA. Pump: The patient initially was in significant decompensated\nheart failure. As a result , the patient was immediately started\non diuretics with torsemide IV 100 mg twice a day with a goal of\n-1 to -2 liters daily. Daily weights and strict I &amp; Os were\nmonitored daily. The patient was also placed on 1 liter free\nwater restriction and 2 liters fluid restriction. Digoxin levels\nwere shown to be in normal range. The patient was continued on\ndigoxin , Isordil , and thiazides were held secondary to patient's\nhyponatremia. Over the hospital course , the patient's\nhyponatremia improved significantly and gradually back up in to\nthe 130s. The patient continued to diurese well initially with a\nweight of 83.5 kilograms. At the time of discharge , the\npatient's weight was approximately 273 kilograms. The patient\nalso continued to show much improvement in terms of energy level.\nSubjectively , the patient felt better. Zestril was also slowly\nadded to patient's CHF regimen. At the time of discharge ,\nZestril 10 mg per day was added. A beta-blocker was also added ,\nspecifically Coreg at 3.125 mg twice daily , Aldactone 25 mg once\ndaily was also added to the regimen. In terms of diuresis\ninitially , the patient was on 100 mg b.i.d. p.o. torsemide and at\none point was switched to Lasix drip as the patient was not\nresponding to diuretics. Eventually the patient was transitioned\nback to an oral regimen with torsemide ultimately at 50 mg p.o.\nb.i.d.\nEchocardiogram was also performed which showed significant mitral\nregurgitation with reversal of flow in the pulmonary venous\nsystem. As a result , there was consideration and discussion\nabout mitral valve replacement. The patient is amenable to\nprocedure performed by Dr. Mcgrue This will be discussed and\ncoordinated by his office and him. This will be a percutaneous\nprocedure possibly.\nThe patient's electrolytes were monitored twice daily as the\npatient was actively being diuresed. Electrolytes were repleted\np.r.n.\nB. Rhythm: The patient has no active arrhythmias. However , the\npatient's ICD and biventricular pacemaker was found to be towards\nend of life and required replacement. As a result , although not\nurgent during this admission , ICD/biventricular pacer was\nreplaced by Dr. Neuse on 7/26/05. The patient tolerated the\nprocedure very well with no complications. The patient's ICD\npocket was checked for any signs of pocket hematoma or other\ncomplications. The patient is stable and new ICD/pacer is\nfunctioning properly. No signs of bleeding or infection.\nC. Ischemia: There are no active issues. EKGs demonstrated no\nsigns of cardiac ischemia. The patient was chest pain free\nthroughout the hospitalization.\n2. Endocrine: The patient's home regimen was held and the\npatient was continued only on a insulin sliding scale after meals\nand at bedtime. Fingersticks demonstrated good sugar control.\nFingersticks were managed mostly between 100 and 120.\n3. FEN: The patient was on diabetic diet. The patient was also\nchecked twice daily for electrolytes and repleted for magnesium\nand potassium scale. Sodium was also monitored as the patient\nwas initially admitted for hyponatremia. As a result , all\nthiazides were held.\n4. Hematology: The patient had a home dose of Coumadin 5 mg\nMonday , Wednesday , Friday. The patient's regimen was continued\nas inpatient and was slightly modified eventually to\napproximately 2 to 2.5 mg once daily. INR was maintained\ntherapeutic throughout the hospitalization. ICD replacement\nprocedure per Dr. Bjella The patient was continued with the\nfoal INR between 2.0 to 2.5.\n5. Psyche/Neuro: Continued patient's home regimen of Xanax ,\nNeurontin and pain medication to control chronic back pain.\n6. Prophylaxis: For DVT prophylaxis , the patient was on Coumadin\nwith therapeutic INR. For GI prophylaxis , the patient was placed\non Nexium.\nPhysical therapy consult was also called to evaluate the\npatient's functional status. The patient also underwent regular\nphysical therapy sessions inhouse to improve functional status.",

This may also have contributed to patient's\ndecompensated heart failure and also initial complaints of\nfeeling weak. Urine culture demonstrated that the patient had\ncitrobacter that was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. As a result ,\nthe patient was started on a course of ciprofloxacin. The\npatient was also placed in isolation as the strain was resistant\nto gentamicin. The patient after treatment was taken off contact\nisolation. The patient was afebrile.

She had no clubbing , cyanosis , or palpable edema.\nShe has 1+ distal pulses noted.\nHer EKG was normal sinus rhythm with ST depressions in the\ninferolateral leads and a right bundle-branch block was present.\nHer chest x-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates\nconsistent with edema. So the patient was admitted to the\ncoronary care unit and a consult with Cardiovascular Surgery and\nserial crits were performed. The patient's condition continued\nto deteriorate. She developed respiratory distress. Anesthesia\nwas called and her airway was secured via an emergent intubation.\nThe patient subsequently developed signs of abdominal pain and\npresumed sepsis and ischemic bowel. She was brought to the\noperating room for an exploratory laparotomy. Status post an\nexploratory laparotomy the patient had a complex course in the\nsurgical ICU where she underwent multi-organ system dysfunction.\nHer prognosis was very dire.

He was found to\nbe in atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin , with\ncontinuation of the Toprol for rate control. He was cardioverted\nin July 2006 , resulting in symptomatic improvement until March 2006\nwhen he again reportedly felt weak , had increased dyspnea with\nexertion. An echocardiogram was done in March 2006 , showing an\nejection fraction of 28%. Given his increased risk for sudden\ndeath , a single-chamber ICD was placed.\nHe continued to feel even more unwell towards the later end of\nMarch , with episodes of nausea , diaphoresis , shortness of breath ,\nand abdominal pain with exertion ( these were his typical angina\nsymptoms in the past ). Consequently , ETT was done on 9/15/2006 ,\nwhich was terminated after 1 minute when the patient's heart rate\nwent up to 130. Electrophysiology adjusted his ICD , still he\nreports continued symptoms as previously described as well as\ndecreased appetite and weight gain of 15 pounds over 6 weeks. He\nendorses worsening orthopnea and PND over the several weeks prior\nto admission. He was started on amiodarone on 4/13/2006 for\natrial fibrillation. Given his worsening symptoms , he presented\nto Dr. Gabard 's clinic on the day of admission for evaluation. He\nwas admitted for diuresis in the setting of a CHF exacerbation\nand for consideration of options in the treatment of his atrial\nfibrillation.",

On\npresentation , he was compensated for his congestive heart\nfailure , with a creatinine of 1.6. The daily goal for his was -2\nto 2.5 L , and he did very well on this dose of Lasix for the in\nand out goal. He was switched over to Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily on\n7/13/2006. His Toprol was continued in-house , but his ACE\ninhibitor was held in the setting of increases in his serum\ncreatinine. The plan was to restart his ACE inhibitor following\ncomplete diuresis to dry weight. There were no symptoms or signs\nconsistent with ischemia in-house. The patient was continued on\naspirin and Zetia for hyperlipidemia.\n2. Atrial Fibrillation: Given the patient's history of atrial\nfibrillation and flutter since 2000 and his continued symptoms on\nToprol ( amiodarone was not an option that the patient wished to\npursue given the side effects of skin discoloration that he had\npreviously experienced ). It was decided to proceed with\ndofetilide therapy on 7/13/2006. His QTc was monitored\nthroughout this process , and the plan was for a transesophageal\nechocardiogram and DC cardioversion on 3/15/2006 for further\ntreatment of the atrial fibrillation. The patient's Coumadin was\ncontinued in-house for a goal INR of between 2 to 3. To achieve\nthis goal , he was continued on his home regimen of Coumadin.\n3. Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was taken\noff oral hypoglycemics in-house but continued on his home dose of\nLantus 24 units before bedtime as well as an insulin sliding\nscale.\nAn addendum will be added to this summary by Dr. Gil Ciciora\neScription document: 3-1094240 HFFocus\nDictated By: DEMOURA , LOUIS\nAttending: PEARYER , ELMER ALEX\nDictation ID 7093843",

He has undergone\nmultiples attempts of revascularization including CABG x2 ,\nrepeated PCI , most recently in 5/13 with intervention on SVG.\nRevascularization options at this point are quite limited , the\namount of active ischemic burden suggested by his recent\nsubmaximal MIBI ETT is unlikely to account for the severity of\nthe symptoms that he is experiencing. Unfortunately , his overall\ndebilitated state makes surgical intervention unlikely to be\ntolerated. He was moderately overloaded at the time of arrival\nand was aggressively diuresed. An echocardiogram was performed\non 11/11/05 , which showed moderate known perivalvular mitral\nvalve leakage and an EF of 30%. A right heart catheterization\nwas performed on 2/28/05 which showed RA pressure 7/7 , mean 5;\nRV 52/1 , mean 4; PA 54/17 , mean 34; and PW 21/40 , mean 23. In\nsummary , overall dry after aggressive diuresis; however , with\nlarge amounts of mitral regurgitation. For this reason , it was\ndiscussed with the family possible clamping for his mitral valve\nas he is not a candidate for mitral valve replacement given his\nend-stage heart and generally frail state. Plan as of the time\nof this dictation is to undergo TEE on 11/1/05 to evaluate\nwhether clamping of the mitral valve would be possible and then\nto have mitral valve clamping later this week. The patient was\ndiuresed effectively with Lasix 200 mg IV b.i.d. with metolazone.\nThe patient was also started on digoxin and Aldactone. He had a\nbump in his creatinine to 2.2 on 1/29/05 and then it continued\nto rise and for this reason diuresis was held as of 0/10/05. As\nfor rhythm , paced , normal sinus rhythm , on telemetry. O 7/27/05\nbrief round of V-tach , paced out of it. An AICD and pacer in\nplace.\nPulmonary: COPD. On O2 at home , however , with increased\ndesaturation here in the hospital to mid 80s while walking ,\nthought secondary to his extreme mitral valve regurgitation.

She was originally admitted to\nthe outside hospital on 10/28/05 with abdominal pain. The CT\nscan showed free air. She also had acute renal failure with a\ncreatinine of 1.8. She was taken to the operating room where she\nunderwent exploratory laparotomy and where she was found to have\na mid descending colonic perforation secondary to diverticulitis.\nShe underwent a partial left colectomy and end colostomy with\nHartmann's pouch. She was placed on clindamycin and levofloxacin\npostoperatively. She was extubated on postoperative day #3. She\nhad persistent elevated white blood cell count for which they\nchanged antibiotics to Flagyl and fluconazole. A CT scan\nrevealed questionable dehiscence of her abdominal wound and a\nbinder was placed. She was subsequently found to be C. diff\npositive. She was reintubated for respiratory distress on\npostoperative day #7 along with decreased blood pressures and\nincreased white blood cell count. She was started on\nhydrocortisone and pressors were also started. She was extubated\non postoperative day #13 and was started on p.o. meds\nsubsequently. She was started on her home BiPAP settings. She\nis also started on diltiazem drip for her paroxysmal atrial\nfibrillation. She was transferred over to the Vau Haain Medical Center for surgical intervention of her abdominal wound\ndehiscence.",

On 6/10/06 , percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube\ninsertion.\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE FROM 1/25/06 THROUGH 4/21/06:\nNeuro: The patient was maintained on oxycodone per NG tube\ninitially and then per G-tube for analgesia. She also received\nSeroquel for agitation and hallucinations. Upon discharge to\nrehabilitation , the patient was alert and oriented , moves all\nextremities and following commands. She had good pain control on\noxycodone elixir and Seroquel.\nCardiovascular: The patient remained hemodynamically stable\nafter her initial septic event. She remained in a normal sinus\nrhythm for the remainder of her ICU course. She was maintained\non Lopressor 100 per per G-tube q.i.d. Her pressures tolerated\nthis dose.\nPulmonary: The patient continued on BiPAP failing each trial off\nthe BiPAP. She would become tachypneic and desaturate with\nelevation of her pCO2 once off BiPAP. After several days off\nBiPAP trials , the decision was made and discussed with the family\nand the patient regarding her need for tracheostomy. It was\nexplained to her that tidal volumes were low and would drop off\nBiPAP and that she would benefit from a tracheostomy placement.\nThe patient was consented and informed and taken to the operating\nroom on 4/0/06 where she underwent a tracheostomy. She\ntolerated the procedure well. She was quickly weaned to pressure\nsupport ventilation. She was maintained on minimal vent settings\nfor a couple of days postoperatively. She was eventually trach\ncollared , as she has been over the last three to four days. The\npatient does tire out after two to three hours of trach collar ,\nafter which we placed her back to pressure support ventilation.\nThe patient has also had some mild bilateral pleural effusion on\nchest x-ray that has not progressed and has been stable\nthroughout her course. The patient has a history of obstructive\nsleep apnea and COPD at baseline. The patient received inhaler\nand nebulizers standing and p.r.n. She will need to continue her\ntrach collar trials most likely having more trach collar trials\nat smaller intervals. The patient's current vent settings upon\ndischarge to rehabilitation are pressure support 5 and 10 , tidal\nvolumes 350-400 , breathing at a rate of 23 , and saturating 99% on\nan FIO2 of 40%.",

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-4": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  This was a 70-year-old female with\nCHF , coronary artery disease , diabetes , peripheral vascular\ndisease , and chronic renal insufficiency that was admitted on\n0/5/06 for weakness and confusion. She had been recently\nhospitalized on 8/1/06 through 9/11/06 and 5/6/06 through\n5/24/06 for CHF exacerbation requiring aggressive diuresis.\nHer weight on discharge on 5/24/06 was 85 kg. She did well\ninitially at home after discharge , but two days prior to\nadmission , had increasing somnolence and confusion with global\nweakness causing the patient to fall without head trauma or loss\nof consciousness. The patient had decreased p.o. intake and was\nfebrile to 99.5. On admission , her weight was 83.9 kg. She was\nhypotensive with blood pressures of 100/50. Her JVP was elevated to\n15 and 3+ pitting edema. She had a BNP of 2321 and a white cell\ncount of 18.9.\nAssessment: An assessment on admission suggested that the\npatient possibly had hypoperfusion secondary to over diuresis or\nworsening heart failure secondary to a cardiac event with a note\nof having a troponin of 2.61.\nHospital Course: Her hospital course after admission on 0/5/06 was\ncomplicated by worsening cardiac function with minimal improvement on milrinone\nand decreasing urine output despite diuretics and also gross gastrointestinal\nbleeding with melanotic stool while she was on Coumadin for atrial\nfibrillation. In addition , there was concern for sepsis. The patient was on\nantibiotics with levofloxacin , Flagyl , and vancomycin. She required a transfer\nto the Cardiac Care Unit on 9/15/06 for further medical therapy for poor\ncardiac output , a\npossible need for CVVH , given volume overload in the setting of renal failure ,\nand work-up of GIB. Her code status was DNR/DNI during her admission into the\nCCU on 9/23/06. The patient reversed her status to DNR , but allowed for\nelective intubation on 9/15/06 , given her increasing GI bleed and the\nworsening renal failure. The patient was electively intubated on 5/27/06\nwithout any complications. For her GI bleed , she had an EGD and colonoscopy ,\nwhich found a\ngross large ascending colorectal mass with ulcerations , which likely\ncontributed to her gross GI bleed. Given the patient's wishes to\nbe DNR/DNI and given her new finding for a large mass in the\nascending colon , the patient's code status was changed to comfort\nmeasures only on 1/17/06. In addition , her colorectal mass pathology returned\nshowing poorly differentiated tumor with lymphoma versus adenocarcinoma being\nmost likely as the diagnosis. For the above reason , the patient was also made\nCMO.\nBeing CMO status , she was removed of all pressors and\nantibiotics in the morning of 1/17/06. She was made comfortable sedated on\nfentanyl and Versed. She was then extubated for comfort with family present.\nShe had agonal breathing with episodes of apnea and was given additional\nsedation for comfort. The patient drew her last breath at 2:20 p.m. Her\nfamily was present at bedside. The attending was aware.\nOn assessment , the patient had no spontaneous breathing , no corneal reflex ,\nand no peripheral pulses. The patient's eyes were dilated and no heart\nsounds or breath sounds were appreciated. Given the CMO status ,\nno CPR was undertaken. The patient was pronounced dead at 2:20\np.m. on 1/17/06. Family declined autopsy.\neScription document: 3-8774785 CSSten Tel\nDictated By: BOYDSTUN , JOHNNY\nAttending: PETITJEAN , SIMON\nDictation ID 3563977",

She has\na history of hypertension. She presented in 1991 with shortness of\nbreath , substernal chest pain , and three pillow orthopnea. She\nruled out for a myocardial infarction back then and was thought to\nbe in congestive heart failure secondary to hypertension. An echo ,\nat that time , showed a moderately dilated left ventricular ,\nmoderately concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , abnormal septal\nmotion , and diffuse severe left ventricular contractive function.\nShe was also noted to have MR , AI , and TR , at that time. An\nexercise tolerance test was done and she went for two to three\nminutes with no ECG changes , but with chest pain and underwent\ncardiac catheterization. Her coronaries were clear , at that time ,\nbut the catheterization did reveal restrictive etiology with\nequilibria of pressures that separated with Valsalva maneuvers.\nThe patient was also noted to have a hematocrit of 34 with black\ntarry stool , at that time , and there was no work up done. The\npatient did well for a few years after that and , in 1997 , she had\nan echo which showed an ejection fraction of 55%. The patient did\nwell again until three to four months ago when she began having\nshortness of breath. On 3 of October 1998 , she had swelling in her\nfeet , dyspnea on exertion after half a block or stairs , and chest\npain on exertion. The chest pain was subxiphoid and is a pressure\nlike pain. The patient also had palpitations on occasions with the\nchest pain. The pain did not radiate. After five to 15 minutes of\nrest , the pain would go away. The patient does have three pillow\northopnea , but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and no syncope. She\nhas no fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or dysuria.\nLast Tuesday , she went running for a bus and had shortness of\nbreath , chest pain , and diaphoresis. After 15 minutes , she felt\nbetter. She came in for a troponin level of 0.01 , she ruled out.\nHer cardiac risk factors are diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,\nhypercholesterolemia , history of tobacco , obesity , and family\nhistory with mother who died of a heart attack in her 70s. The\npatient has new ECG findings with a left bundle branch block.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-2": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  On examination , the patient's vital signs\nwere stable with a temperature of 98 , heart\nrate 93 , blood pressure 138/90 , and respiratory rate 20.

Two days prior to admission\nhere , she experienced shortness of breath at rest and some\nlightheadedness. At baseline , she becomes dyspneic after walking\n20 feet secondary to obesity and many years of smoking. She also\nnotes several days of headache and some questionable darkening in\nher visual fields bilaterally. She admits that her p.o. intake\nhas been rather poor since coming home secondary to anorexia and\nthat she has felt dehydrated. On review of systems , she also\nnotes chronic waxing and waning erythema of the right lower\nextremity which in recent days has worsened with accompanying\nswelling and mild tenderness , although her son says that it has\nbeen worse in the past. Also , she has noted loose stools since\n6/2/06. She denies chest pain , pleurisy , abdominal pain , blood\nin her stool or urine , dysuria , change in frequency , character or\nurination , or focal weakness. No new medications other than a\nrecent antibiotic course at Dale Skin Sonmu Medical Center completed there for\npneumonia. She has not taken her lisinopril or methadone in the\nlast two days. She has no sick contact. She saw her PCP on\n0/10/06 who found her to be hypotensive and hypoxic and then\nsent her to Ma County Hospital ED. Her family is not clear on her\ndischarge diagnosis , but they report that her kidney function was\nabnormal and she was dehydrated. She was not admitted. She then\ncame to the ED at Town Medical Center And Clinics for persistent shortness of\nbreath and dizziness. In the ED , her vital signs were that she\nwas afebrile , her systolic blood pressure was in the high 60's ,\nher heart rate was 110 , respiratory rate in the 30's , and O2\nsaturations were in the high 80's. She was given vancomycin ,\nLevaquin and gentamicin and 3 liters of normal saline. She was\naggressively given fluids and was started on Levophed for blood\npressure support. Her EKG was notable for low voltage on\nprecordial leads and borderline right axis deviation. Chest\nx-ray showed cardiomegaly , but otherwise clear. In the MICU , her\nblood pressure was stabilized on Levophed , but she was also noted\nto drop her blood pressure to the 70's when initiated on her home\nBiPAP settings.",
        "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY-4": "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY \nShe had endocarditis 20 years ago. She has obstructive sleep\napnea , on her home BiPAP , morbid obesity , and hypertension. She\nhad a right ankle injury more than 20 years ago during the motor\nvehicle accident , which was complicated by an ankle infection.\nShe has chronic right lower extremity pain and she is on\nmethadone. She had a Klonopin overdose. She had Enterobacter\npneumonia. She was treated with cefepime at that time ,\nquestionable the vancomycin.

        "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN-10": "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN \nThis is a 49-year-old woman with a recent ICU stay at an outside\nhospital who presented with hypotension , tachycardia , and acute\nrenal failure. Presentation was most consistent with right\npulmonary embolus and right ventricular failure.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM \n1. Pulmonary/Vascular: There was initial concern for a PE given\nthe presentation of severe hypotension , tachycardia , and Aa\ngradient without evidence of infection or primary cardiac\ndisease. An echo showed a dilated RV with depressed RV function\nsuggestive of PE. Her initial PE scan was nondiagnostic\nsecondary to poorly timed contrast and motion of the patient. A\nVQ scan showed intermediate probability. She was started on\nheparin drip with a goal of 60 to 80. Her second PECT showed a\nsmall PE to the right upper lobe , but it was not large enough to\nexplain her dramatic presentation. The working hypothesis is\nthat there was a significant recanalization prior to this repeat\nCT which took place two days after the first CT. She was\ninitially on oxygen in the ICU. She was never intubated. She\nwas on face mask , and upon transfer to the floor , she was on\nnasal cannula 4 liters. Her O2 saturations were acceptable\nin-house , although she did desaturate to 90% when she took her\noxygen off a night. She multiple times refused BiPAP while in\nthe hospital , but she will go back on it when she returns home.\n2. Cardiovascular: She had a mild troponin elevation on\nadmission , likely secondary to RV strain. She had severe\nhypotension and was on two pressors. She was weaned off of these\non 4/15/06 , but did have an episode of hypotension when her\nBiPAP was started. She was given a little bit of low dose\ndobutamine and then she was weaned off of that on 3/6/06.\nRhythm: She has no active issues. We continued to hold her\nlisinopril while in-house. Her blood pressures were stable , but\nnot high enough to withstand on additional blood pressure\nlowering medication. It was discussed with her PCP that she\nperhaps will need this medication restarted as an outpatient.\nShe does have a history of severe hypertension.\n3. Renal: As she was in acute failure on admission with a\ncreatinine of 6.9 , it dropped to 0.5 , most likely this was due to\nprerenal azotemia and decreased renal perfusion in the setting of\nhypotension. Hypoperfusion of the kidneys in setting of\nhypovolemia and right heart failure resulting in decreased left\nventricular preload. Mucomyst and bicarb were given prior to the\nPECTs of her renal protection. She did not develop any\nadditional contrast nephropathy after her CT scans. Her\ncreatinine on discharge was 0.6.\n4. Endocrine: She had a normal increase in her cortisol level\nwith ACTH stimulation. Her fingersticks were monitored while she\nwas in-house and she never had any need for supplemental insulin.\n5. FEN: She was on a house diet.\n6. ID: She was empirically covered on admission with\nvancomycin , levofloxacin and gentamicin. Her antibiotics were\ngiven again on 10/16/06 and on 11/13/06. There was no evidence\nof an infection found , no fever , normal white count , with a\nnormal differential , normal UA , chest x-ray is without\ninfiltrate , and antibiotics were discontinued on 4/21/06. She\ncontinued to remain afebrile in-house without any evidence of\ninfection.\n7. Urology: She did complain of bladder spasms while having the\nFoley in place. She was started on Ditropan. She had multiple\nnegative urinalysis and urine cultures. Once the Foley was\ndiscontinued , she was able to void and she stopped having bladder\nspasms. She was started on Monistat for a yeast infection.\n8. Allergy: She did have an elevated eosinophilia on\npresentation and it was 4% on admission and increased to 8% on\n4/21/06. On the day of discharge , it was 7.5. There is no\nclinical evidence of allergy , rheumatic disease or parasitic\ninfection. Her obstructive lung disease may be of an asthma\nvariant , and there is the possibility she may need inhaled\ncorticosteroids as an outpatient.\n9. Heme: She was on unfractionated heparin for her presumed PE\nuntil 6/15/06 and then she was changed to Lovenox in the morning\nof that day on 120 mg subq. Her weight at that time was 157 kg.\nHer Coumadin , her initially given 10 , then a dose of 5 and then 2\ndose of 7.5. Her INR was therapeutic on the day of discharge at\n2.5. She will continue on the Lovenox for two additional days.\nHer INR will be monitored by Dr. Kid , her PCP.\n10. Psych/Addiction: We are continuing her methadone. It has\nbeen switched from 20 mg p.o. daily to 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. She was\nalso given a little bit of Ativan while in-house to help with her\nagitation and anxiety. She was initially given a little bit of\nHaldol , but that was discontinued on 8/4/06 and there was no\nadditional need for that. She did have a central line placed on\n4/18/06 , which was discontinued on 6/15/06 without any evidence\nof any line infection and without any problems. She was seen by\nSocial Work and PT. The patient refused to go to any sort of\nrehab or nursing home. It was decided that the patient would\nreturn home with skilled nursing and with PT as needed.\neScription document: 1-3509519 EMSSten Tel\nDictated By: MCMAIN , MITCHELL\nAttending: MCDUGLE , VINCENZO\nDictation ID 6997683",

Pain could be due to patient's VATS\nprocedure. Patient was initially placed on heparin , asa , bblocker , ace ,\nhigh dose statin. Heparin was discontinued and patient was d/c'd on her\noutpatient cardiac medications.\nPump: BP's elevated in ER to 177/95. It is unclear whether patient had\nbeen taking cardiac meds during the week. When patient was placed back\non her outpatient cardiac bp medicines she was well controlled with bp\n130s/80s.\nRhythm: The patient remained in nsr during the hospitalization.\nPulmonary: newly diagnosed interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.

Patient was continued on synthroid.\nPain control: The patient has a history of admission for Chest wall pain\nfor VATS. VATs procedure done 3 weeks ago and per outpatient\npulmonologist , patient had been requiring large doses of opioids per her\nfamily members. The patient , however , did not complain of\nincreased pain at her outpatient visit. During this admission , the\npatient did not request any prn pain medication and was comfortable with\nregular heart rate throughout the admission. The patient should no\nlonger require opioids for pain due to the VATS procedure.

The\npatient's cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,\nhypertension , hypercholesterolemia , a positive family history ,\nprevious history of smoking as well as postmenopausal state\nsecondary to hysterectomy 21 years ago and not on estrogen\nreplacement therapy. The patient has a two to three year history\nof exertional angina. Of note , approximately one year ago she\nbegan to have substernal chest pain at rest. The patient states\nthat currently she is having approximately three episodes a day on\naverage. She describes these as substernal chest pressure which\nradiates to her bilateral arms as well as her jaw. She denies any\nassociated shortness of breath but does occasionally note\ndiaphoresis. She denies any nausea or vomiting or palpitations.\nIn July of 1994 the patient underwent an echocardiogram which\nshowed a left atrial size of 4.0 cm and ejection fraction of\napproximately 60% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild\ntricuspid regurgitation. Since this time she has been followed by\nDr. Maximo Bryum in C&O MEDICAL CENTER Clinic who initiated an antianginal regimen\nwhich resulted in decreased frequency of her symptoms. Of note the\npatient recently stopped taking Aspirin. Her symptoms then\nrecurred. On the 27 of January , 1995 the patient underwent a\nDobutamine MIBBE on which she went 6 minutes and 48 seconds\nreaching a maximal heart rate of 154 , a blood pressure of 172/82.\nThe test showed 2 mm ST depressions diffusely. The MIBBE showed\nmoderate to severe reversible anterior and anteroseptal wall\nischemia. Of note , on the morning of admission the patient was\nseen by her VNA. During her VNA's visit the patient began to have\nher typical anginal symptoms with radiation to her arms and jaw as\nwell as shortness of breath. She denied any diaphoresis or nausea.\nThe patient was given three sublingual Nitroglycerins after her\nprimary M.D. was called and her pain resolved after approximately\n15 minutes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for a 10 year\nhistory of Insulin dependent diabetes with complications including\nneuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic atrial fibrillation included a\nnormal TSH. Hypertension. Degenerative joint disease.\nGastroesophageal reflux. Status post hysterectomy approximately 21\nyears ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,\nAxid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.\nwhich the patient recently stopped , Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,\nDiltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopipd 600\nmg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Insulin , NPH , 75 units sub-q\nq.a.m. , 50 units q.p.m. , Insulin Regular 25 units sub-q q.a.m.",

HEENT exam showed pupils equal\nround and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact.\nOropharynx was clear. Mucous membranes were moist. Neck was\nsupple with full range of motion. Jugular venous pressure was\ndifficult to assess secondary to increased soft tissue around the\nneck. Carotids were 2+ and without bruits. Cardiac exam showed an\nirregularly irregular rate and rhythm , a normal S-1 and S-2 , a I/VI\nsystolic ejection murmur noted at the left upper sternal border.\nLungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. Abdomen was soft ,\nnontender , obese with active bowel sounds. Extremities showed a\nright shin scar which was healing well. There was no clubbing or\ncyanosis , no evidence of any femoral bruits. Rectal examination\nwas guaiac negative. On neurologic examination the patient was\nalert and oriented x 2. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.\nStrength was 5/5 bilaterally.

Chest x-ray showed no\nevidence of infiltrates or effusions. There was borderline\ncardiomegaly.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-7": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted to Medicine Team Voone Parkway , Ainggo Ra I , Alaska 89772\nShe was ruled out for myocardial infarction with\nserial CK , MB and EKG's. Heparin was initially started given the\npossibility that this was unstable angina. The Cardiology Team was\nconsulted for recommendations on possible cardiac catheterization.\nOn further review of her history the Cardiology Team decided to\nschedule a cardiac catheterization. This was performed on the 4 of June and showed mildly elevated right sided pressure including a\nright atrial pressure of 15 , an RV pressure of 50/16 with a mean PA\npressure of 32 , pulmonary capillary wedge of 22. The coronary\narteries were noted to be normal and left ventricular function was\nalso assessed as normal. The patient tolerated this procedure well\nand without complications. Given the confluence of her data , two\npossible explanations were postulated including either syndrome X\nor small vessel disease , not noted on cardiac catheterization. The\npatient remained stable , status post cardiac catheterization and\nwas prepared for discharge. Also during her hospital course the\npatient's Insulin dosages were adjusted in the manner to keep her\nblood sugars in the approximately 200 range.",

His\nwhite blood cell count had increased to 20. His INR had been\nsupratherapeutic on admission at that time to 14. At that time ,\nhe had had a transesophageal echocardiogram which did not show\nany vegetations and he was discharged to rehab on 3/14/06 with a\ncourse of IV penicillin through a PICC line , as well as oral\nFlagyl empirically for an elevated white count. At the rehab\nfacility where he was placed , the patient was found to have\npulled his PICC line and the patient was complaining of being\nshort of breath and having some mental status changes. He was\ntreated with some sublingual nitroglycerin at the outside\nfacility and brought to the Ellwis Medical Center Emergency Room , where a chest\nx-ray showed some lack of the PICC line and the short of breath\nquickly improved in the emergency room. He was , however ,\nlethargic and then at times , apneic in the emergency room. A gas\nwas performed which showed respiratory alkalosis with a pH of\n7.5 , a pCO2 of 34 and a pAO2 of 135. The patient then became\nslightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures to the 90s ,\nwas given IV fluid boluses as well as treated empirically with\nvancomycin and ceftazidime , to which his blood pressure responded\nby going up to around 100-110/60. Given his apnea , a CPAP was\ninitiated in the emergency department and his oxygenation issues\nquickly resolved. A head CT was performed , which was negative.\nA right internal jugular line was placed and gentle rehydration\ntherapy according to early goal-directed therapy for peri-sepsis\nwas initiated , given the presumption of repeat bacteremia and\nearly sepsis. He was admitted to medicine for further\nmanagement.",
        "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY-5": "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  Coronary artery disease status post MI in\n2004 and a cath in 2005. He is status post a hip fracture in\n2005.

He is satting 98% on a CPAP machine. In general , he\nwas in no acute distress in restraints. His head and neck exam\nwas notable for a supple neck. Pupils are equal , round and\nreactive. His heart demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm. His\nJVP was flat. He did not demonstrate any murmurs , rubs , or\ngallops. His pulmonary exam was clear anteriorly. His abdominal\nexam was noted for being soft , nontender , and nondistended with\npositive bowel sounds and mild tympani. He had good peripheral\npulses with trace lower extremity edema. His neuro exam was\nnonfocal.",
        "OPERATIONS-9": "OPERATIONS  During his hospital stay at this time included a PEG\ntube placement which happened on 4/2/06.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM-10": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM \n1. ID: The patient has a history of recent strep oralis\nbacteremia and leukocytosis. He was afebrile at the time of\nadmission; however , given concern for possible early sepsis given\nhis blood pressure , he was treated with empiric IV fluids and\nantibiotics with vancomycin and ceftazidime. His chest x-ray\nlooked like it might have some aspiration and he was treated with\nan empiric 7-day course of Ceptaz and Flagyl for aspiration\npneumonia. This course was completed earlier in his hospital\nstay. He was also initially treated with vancomycin. A PICC was\nplaced on 11/0/06 for further antibiotic management of his\nbacteremia. His vancomycin was switched to IV penicillin and\nthis will be continued for a full 3-4 week course on 8/14/07. A\nTEE was considered unnecessary given the fact that he was going\nto be treated anyway with antibiotics for 4 weeks. All blood ,\nurine , sputum cultures and stool cultures remained no growth to\ndate at the time of discharge.\n2. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient demonstrated some\napnea in the Emergency Department which resolved with CPAP;\nhowever , given the fact that the patient was a significant\naspiration risk , a CPAP was considered unnecessary and possibly\nwould increase the risk of aspiration. Pulmonary was consulted ,\nwho felt that the patient was demonstrating Cheyne-Stokes\nrespirations secondary to possible CHF or history of CVAs that he\nhas had in the past. His ABG , as I mentioned above , demonstrated\nrespiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.\nHis repeat ABG showed no significant change , which likely\nindicates a chronic process. He did not demonstrate any PEs on\nstudies that were performed here. No pneumonia was noted and the\ndesaturations that were detected while the patient was sleeping\novernight on 15 units O2 sat monitor resolved quickly with 2\nliters of oxygen by nasal cannula. A plan was made to not\nreinitiate CPAP given the aspiration risk. He was initially\ndiuresed mildly with Lasix. This was eventually discontinued.\nThe patient should receive nighttime supplemental oxygen ,\nparticularly if he desaturates to less than 90%.\n3. Cardiovascular: The patient is status post an MI , status\npost PCI in 2004. His enzymes were negative on this admission\nand a repeat EKG was unchanged from previous. The patient was\nrestarted on his home doses of aspirin , statin , beta blocker 2\npump. The patient's ejection fraction was 45-50% with inferior\nwall hypokinesis. Hypotension improved on admission , restarted\nhis beta blocker and his ACE inhibitor and IV fluids at the time\nof discharge. Re the patient's history of a-fib , he was in\nnormal sinus rhythm for the majority of his hospital stay.\nCoumadin was held peri-procedure when he was getting his PEG\nplaced and vitamin K had been administered in view of his\nsupratherapeutic Coumadin. His Coumadin should be restarted on\n0/30/07. Of note as well for rhythm issues , the patient was\nkept on potassium and magnesium scales while in hospital and he\nhas a partial pacemaker placed for his sick sinus syndrome.\n4. GI: The patient had a history of constipation. His abdomen\nwas tympanitic when he first presented. He was given a bowel\nregimen and has subsequently begun making good solid stool.\nMidway through his hospital course , the patient developed trouble\nwith eating. He had multiple NG tubes placed which he was\nself-discontinuing requiring urgent reconsideration of more\npermanent feeding tubes. A discussion was held between our\nservice and the GI team , who felt that a PEG would be useful for\nmanaging this patient's feeding in the future. On 2/25/06 , GI\nendoscopically placed a PEG tube for future feeding. Nutrition\nwas consulted and tube feeds were re-initiated that evening.\nAgain , his Coumadin will be held until 9/23/07 so as to promote\nappropriate wound healing around the site of the PEG placement.\n5. Heme: The patient had a history of anemia but did not\ndemonstrate any acute hematocrit drops. His INR on admission was\n1.9. We had transiently restarted Coumadin but he will have to\nrestart that again on 9/23/07 , given the fact that it was held\nfor his PEG placement. He was continued on iron supplements\nduring his hospital stay.\n6. Renal: The patient , as discussed above , has demonstrated a\nrespiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.\nHis creatinine was mildly elevated which is secondary to chronic\nrenal insufficiency for unclear reasons. His creatinine by the\ntime of discharge had improved dramatically to 0.7.\n7. Endocrine: The patient's oral hypoglycemics were held during\nthis hospital stay. He was started on insulin sliding-scale and\nLantus. As his feeding has increased and his tube feeds have\nreached goal , his Lantus has had to be titrated up. He is\ncurrently at 15 units q. p.m. He may need more while at the\nfacility that he is going to.\n8.

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE  Ms. Mundhenk is a 72-year-old woman with\nmultiple medical problems including severe vasculopathy ( carotid\nstenosis and renal artery stenosis status post renal artery stent\nplacement in 11/22 ) , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia and\nmultiple strokes. She was admitted to an outside hospital with\nunresponsiveness. She was transferred here for management of her\nsevere hypertension and worsening kidney function. During this\nhospital admission , her medications were adjusted. Initially ,\nthe nitro paste was stopped. The Lasix was held. Her minoxidil\nwas also stopped as well. She was continued on clonidine 0.2 mg\np.o. b.i.d. and Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily. Lopressor was also\nstopped during this hospital admission and labetalol was started ,\nwhich was titrated up by the time of this dictation. Her\nantihypertensives include labetalol 300 mg p.o. q.8 h. , Norvasc\n10 mg p.o. daily and clonidine 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d. It is very\nimportant that the patient receive her medications at their\nscheduled times or her blood pressure will rise. She continued\nto complain of headache , particularly on the right side and as\ndetailed above carotid ultrasound revealed a tight right internal\ncarotid artery stenosis. Vascular Surgery was consulted and she\nis currently scheduled to have a left endarterectomy on Friday ,\n9/16/07 after which point she will be cared for by the Vascular\nSurgery Service. Given the patient's kidney disease and severe\nhypertension in addition to recent renal artery stent placement ,\nNephrology was consulted as well during her hospital stay. It\nwas felt that there was no need for intervention regarding her\nrenal arteries or visualization of her kidneys at this time.\nThey agreed with holding the furosemide and changing Lopressor to\nlabetalol and titrating up labetalol as needed. Her clonidine\ncould also be titrated up by 0.1 mg increments should she need\nmore blood pressure control in the future , if her heart rate\ndoes not tolerate higher doses of labetalol. The patient's\ncreatinine on admission was 2.6 , which subsequently decreased to\n2 , however , at the time of this dictation has increased to 2.6\nand it is thought that this may be a result of improved blood\npressure control and may be a new baseline; her creatinine will\nneed to be followed. The patient also has a history of diabetes\nand is on insulin and her insulin regimen including NPH and AC\ncoverage were titrated during this hospital admission.\nHemoglobin A1c was checked during this hospital admission and it\nwas 6.4. TSH was checked as well and it was within normal\nlimits.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE \n1. Cardiovascular:\na. Ischemia: The patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , but\ngiven his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that was\nnegative.\nb. Pump: The patient was felt to be volume overloaded. His\nadmission weight was 130 kg. He was started on IV Lasix for\ndiuresis and began to diurese well putting out approximately 2 to\n3 liters negative per day. He had a right heart catheterization\nwhich showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressure\nof 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggesting\nhigh left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. Cardiac\noutput was 7.83 , cardiac index was 3.09 , SVR was 695 , PVR was\n174. Therefore , the patient was felt to still be volume\noverloaded and was diuresed further. At the time of this\ndictation , his weight has dropped to 118 kg from 130 on\nadmission.\nFrom the perspective of blood pressure , he was started on\nhydralazine and Isordil to reduce his afterload and these were\ntitrated up with the goal systolic blood pressure of less than\n120.\nc. Rhythm: The patient had atrial fibrillation and he was kept\non Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3 except when he was being\nprepped for his right heart cath. He is now being restarted on\nCoumadin following the cath with the goal INR of 2 to 3.\n2. Pulmonary: The patient seemed to have several possible\ncauses for his shortness of breath including volume overload and\nhis underlying COPD and body habitus. An arterial blood gas was\ndone with 2 liters nasal cannula on 10/11/04 and this showed pH\nof 7.28 , CO2 of 76 , oxygen of 67 , and bicarbonate of 37. This is\non 2 liters nasal cannula giving an A-a gradient of 16. Compared\nto his prior ABG in March 2003 , which showed pH 7.43 , carbon\ndioxide of 52 , and oxygen of 60 with a bicarbonate of 37. This\nsuggested that the patient was hypoventilating. Therefore , he\nwas started on BiPAP overnight and he said that his sense of\ncomfort of breathing improved following BiPAP. At this point , he\nwill be sent home on home BiPAP.\n3. Chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateral\neffusions , which were confirmed on a chest CT. However , because\nthe patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to be\nimproving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted.\n4. Dermatological: The patient had severe skin thickening from\nhis lymphedema. Dermatology was consulted for proper care of his\nlegs. They were initially concerned that there could have been a\nsuperimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started on\nlevofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significant\nclinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacin\nwas discontinued after two days. Dermatology made specific\nrecommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strength\nDakin's soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed by\nbetamethasone cream and Lac-Hydrin cream mixture twice a day.\nThere is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of the\npatient's nose for which Dermatology performed a shave biopsy for\nconcern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cell\ncarcinoma. This showed endophytic squamous proliferation with\natypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. This\nwas potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cell\ncarcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitive\ndiagnosis. Deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point.\n5. Urology: The patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urine\noutput into his Foley. Initially , this was dark red; however ,\nthis lightened significantly. There are also some clots evident.\nThe Foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on his\nown; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although it\nappears to have lightened up. Further followup will be required\nlikely with Urology as an outpatient.\n6. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , which\nis well controlled after his recent weight loss. He was\nmaintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale.\n7. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondary\nto his diabetes mellitus. We avoided contrast dye. The\npatient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresis\nprocess going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 7/18/04.\nThe discharge medications and instructions will be dictated as an\naddendum at the time of discharge.\neScription document: 5-2098339 ISSten Tel",

The patient then reportedly went into VFib and was\nshocked once by EMS , resulting in a narrow QRS complex rhythm.\nShe was intubated , received amiodarone and dopamine , as her BP was\napproximately 70s systolic over palpable diastolic. In the ED , a portable\nchest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral opacities , risk of pulmonary edema and\nABG showed respiratory acidosis. Pt was transferred to the ICU for further\nmanagement.\nOf note , she was recently hospitalized at Somver Vasky University Of Medical Center on 1/5/06\nthrough 11/11/07 for initiation of dialysis after her BUN and creatinine\nhad risen remarkably from baseline. She was then asymptomatic at\nthat time. A fistulogram and angioplasty of her right AV fistula\nwas performed on 9/14/06 with prednisone premedication but it\nwas unsuccessful and therefore a left IJ tunneled dialysis\ncatheter was inserted on 10/18/06 with the tip ending in the\nright atrium. She has since received dialysis treatments with no\ncomplication.",

The patient is an obese woman who was\nintubated and responded to voice. Her pupils were 3 to 2 mm\nbilaterally. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her chest\nexam was notable for diffuse crackles throughout with good air\nmovement. Cardiac auscultation revealed regular rate and rhythm\nwith no murmurs , rubs or gallops.

The\npatient had difficulty weaning from vent and was finally\nextubated on 0/22/06. The CCU course was also complicated by\ncoag-negative Staph grown from a Quinton catheter blood draw.\nThe catheter was changed to over a wire on 0/22/06. Blood\ncultures on 1/10/06 revealed likely Staph aureus growth for\nwhich the patient received continuous vancomycin.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS-13": "HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS \n1. Question of VFib arrest. Whether or not the patient actually\nhad a VFib arrest seems to be in some doubt as she never had an\narrhythmia on tele here by report and her troponin when peaked at\n0.14 on 8/1/06 after receiving one external defibrillator shock\nat hemodialysis. We believe what likely happened was a vagal event during\nhemodialysis , possibly including a pause misread at VF by the defibrillator.\nThis explantation is supported by the observation that she has been\ncontinuously having nausea with dialysis and her known a history\nof vasovagal episodes in the past. Echo on 8/1/06 shows an EF\nof 60 to 65% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy\nand no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was continued on\ntelemetry and treated with her home dose of beta-blocker with\ngood response.\n2. Volume status. The patient is very close to her dry weight\nupon discharge , which she gives at 354 pounds by wet scale. She\nhas been continued on hemodialysis with good results.\n3. Possibly infected hemodialysis catheter. The patient had a\nsingle set of coag-negative Staph positive blood cultures from\nQuinton catheter on 8/8/06. Line was changed over wire\n4/28/06 and was treated with vancomycin dose by renal levels.\nThe patient continued to grow out coag-negative Staph , positive\nblood cultures from 2 out of 2 sets drawn on 8/8/06.\n4. Anemia. In the setting of end-stage renal disease her\nbaseline hematocrit is about 30 and stable.\n5. Diabetes type 2. She was treated with a Portland protocol\nduring her ICU course wand was switched to a long and\nshort-acting subcutaneous insulin approaching her home dose of NPH BID.\n6. FEN. The patient was gradually advanced to an oral diet with\nno signs of aspiration status post extubation.\n7. Prophylaxis. The patient received heparin subcutaneously and\nNexium.\n8. Code. The patient is full code. Her healthcare proxy is her\nson Noble Schomberg , 030-855-6086.",

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-1": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  This is a 56-year-old gentleman with a\nhistory of chest pain and atrial\nfibrillation. His cardiac risk factors included hypertension ,\ncigarette smoking and a family history; no diabetes or cholesterol.\nIn 11/27 , he sustained an IMI complicated by V-tach , cardiogenic\nshock and Dresler's. He was discharged on digoxin and Lasix. He\nsubsequently did well with chest pain only on extreme exertion\ncharacterized by retrosternal burning which radiated to his left\narm with shortness of breath. It did not occur at rest. He saw\nDr. Luthi who prescribed Isordil with much decrement in symptoms.\nIn 0/4 , he was found to be hypertensive with decrease in T-4. He\nwas treated with captopril and Synthroid. In 7/24 , he had new\nonset of atrial fibrillation. He was treated with Quinaglute. In\n1/21 , he noted dizziness with decreased vision episodically. He\nwas treated with the discontinuation of captopril and digoxin was\nbegun. Atrial fibrillation was again documented on a Holter.\nOn 8/25/90 , he was admitted to Onlanfalls Health with atrial\nfibrillation. The quinidine level was 1.6 and digoxin level 0.8 ,\nT-4 9.2. The heart rate was 64 , blood pressure 110/90. He ruled\nout for an MI. He was treated with an increase in his quinidine\nsulfate. His course was complicated by a five second pause. A DDD\npacer was placed. He continued to have light-headedness without\nassociated arrhythmias. An echo revealed an ejection fraction of\n30% with inferior akinesis , left ventricular hypertrophy and a\nsmall pericardial effusion. While in the hospital , he had two\nepisodes of chest pain which were abated by nitroglycerin. There\nwere no brady or tachy arrhythmias noted at the times of the chest\npain. He was off Isordil. The chest pain occurred with walking.\nThere was no chest pain since restarting Isordil. On the monitor\nhe was noted to be in normal sinus rhythm with a first degree heart\nblock and occasional atrial fibrillation. The T-4 value was 9.2.",

        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-3": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  Heart rate 65; blood pressure 120/90;\ntemperature 97.5. The HEENT exam was\nunremarkable. Carotids 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.\nThe lungs were clear. The cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and\nrhythm; S1 and S2; no S3; II/VI systolic murmur at the left upper\nsternal border radiating to the apex; no rubs; PMI nondisplaced;\nJVD 6 cm. The abdomen revealed a cholecystectomy scar. The\nextremities revealed strong pulses and no bruits. The neuro exam\nwas nonfocal.",

The EKG revealed dual\nchamber 100% paced; no atrial activity; rate 65; intervals 0.16 ,\n0.20 and 0.50. An EKG from 2/14 revealed sinus brady at 50;\nintervals 0.22 , 0.12; appropriate QTC; left atrial hypertrophy.\nUrinalysis was notable for a specific gravity of 1.025 , pH 5 ,\npresence of urate crystals. The chest x-ray showed no CHF or\ninfiltrate; cardiomegaly as well as a dual chamber pacer present.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-5": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted to the cardiology Hass\nteam. The Metteand Health Center team preferred to stop the\nQuinidex at this time and observe him for recurrence of atrial\nfibrillation with plans to start Norpace if this occurred. There\nwas no recurrence of atrial fibrillation while in-house. The DDD\nremained in place with settings as per the admission note. He had\na cardiac work up consisting of an echocardiogram revealing an\nejection fraction of 30% with inferior and apical hypokinesis\nconsistent with location of the old MI. He was maintained on\nIsordil and atenolol as part of his admission regimen without\nsymptoms while in-house. On the prior to discharge , he underwent a\nstandard Bruce ETT. He exercised nine minutes stopping secondary\nto fatigue with a peak heart rate of 105; blood pressure increased\nfrom 100/80 to 124/78. There were no ST-T wave changes from\nbaseline. He was thought to be maximally medicated. His pulse\npressure product at rest was excellent and well maintained , and he\nwas asymptomatic. He was maintained on his current cardiac\nregimen.\nHe was noted to have a mildly elevated BUN at 26 and creatinine 1.8\non admission. He was found to have urate crystals in his urine.\nHis BUN decreased to 23 and creatinine 1.3 prior to discharge. We\nwill consider alkalyzing his urine if we suspect a true urate\nnephropathy.",

        "COURSE BY SYSTEM-16": "COURSE BY SYSTEM \nCardiovascular:\n1. Ischemia: The patient did not have any positive cardiac\nenzymes and no evidence of ischemia. She was maintained on\naspirin , a beta-blocker , and a statin.\n2. Pump: The patient was diuresed aggressively. She was\nstarted on a continuous BNP drip along with Lasix 160 mg IV\nb.i.d. plus metolazone as needed to help diurese approximately 1\nliter per day. The patient did not respond to p.o. Lasix. The\npatient was variably responsive to diuretics , but at the time of\ndischarge , had diuresed down the 130.3 kg a drop of approximately\n10 kg or approximately 22 pounds. The patient's BNP at the time\nof discharge was 8 and she was not felt to be in heart failure.\nShe continued to have lower extremity edema that was felt likely\nsecondary to venous stasis and lack of mobilization. Therefore ,\nshe was encouraged to mobilize and given compression stockings to\nhelp mobilize the fluid in her legs. At the time of discharge ,\nshe was diuresing well to oral Bumex and she was maintained on\nBumex in order to keep her ins and outs even each days.\n3. Rhythm: The patient did not have issues from a rhythm\nperspective.\nRenal: The patient had a creatinine that climbed as high as 5.8 ,\nduring her hospitalization. She was felt to have an underlying\ndiabetic nephropathy. The Renal Service ( Dr. Courtney Sissom ) was\nconsulted and felt that the patient would likely eventually need\noutpatient dialysis , however , there was no emergent indication\nfor dialysis at this time. The patient has seen Dr. Hilton V Sheaks , at Fullfirst , Vascular Surgery prior to\nthis for consideration of a fistula placement and she will\ncontinue to follow up with Dr. Sauberan following discharge.\nHematology: The patient was maintained on Coumadin for her\nhistory of a clot in the right and left superficial femoral vein ,\nwhich was diagnosed in 3/24 and was noted to be extending\ntowards the deep venous system. The patient was also continued\non iron for her underlying anemia.\nEndocrine: The patient had diabetes and was maintained on her\nNPH plus a regular insulin sliding scale to control her blood\nsugars and her blood sugars were reasonably well controlled and\ngenerally below 200.\nMusculoskeletal: The patient was complaining of increasing\ncramps in her calves a few days prior to discharge. Therefore ,\nlower extremity noninvasive ultrasound tests were repeated and\nthese ruled out recurrent deep venous thrombosis. A CK was\nchecked and this was normal and therefore , it was felt that the\npatient did not have any evidence of rhabdomyolysis or a\ncompartment syndrome. It was felt that these pains were most\nlikely secondary to venous pooling in the legs combined with\ninactivity. The patient was treated symptomatically with\noxycodone and encouraged to ambulate to help mobilize the fluid\nout of her legs.",

She had a DVT about 10\nyears ago in the left lower extremity. She was coumadinized at that\ntime for 3 months. In July of 1994 she had an abdominal hernia\nrepair and had recurrent DVT by LENIs but was not treated. On 0/28\nshe presented again with a left lower extremity pain and was found\nto have an acute and chronic deep venous thrombosis and was\nanticoagulated with Heparin and changed to Coumadin at home. The\npatient was poorly compliant with her Coumadin. In March of 1995\nshe was too depressed to take her Coumadin. Her INR dropped. She\nhad sharp chest pain like gas over her precordium. The pain cleared\nspontaneously. Eventually she called her REQUEST MEDICAL CENTER primary doctor , Dr.\nBabbish complaining of this pain and was admitted to the Misent Tlhealtmigo Medical Center for rule out MI and rule out PE. VQ scan at that\ntime was low probability. She was discharged on Coumadin 5mg a day\nand Lasix 20mg a day for lower extremity edema. A dobutamine MIBI\nwas also performed and was negative. On 7/14 she came to the EW\ncomplaining of chest pressure and left lower extremity swelling.\nShe reported that since 10/7 she started having right anterior\nchest pain with chest wall pain which was increased with deep\nventilation , no cough.

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-9": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted , heparinized and begun on\nCoumadin with a goal PTT of 60-80 and INR of 2-3.\nHer calf pain was felt secondary to superficial thrombophlebitis\nand post phlebitic syndrome. Interventional Radiology was consulted\nto obtain a PA gram , however they felt that the risk of the\nprocedure outweighed the benefits given that her VQ scan was\nentirely unchanged from prior. Her hypoxia seemed related more to\nher sleep apnea. She was started on CPAP , which she tolerated\nrather poorly , however was encouraged to continue to use it given\nher potential long-term benefits. She had an 02 saturation on room\nair in the high 80s to low 90s , which improved when she used the\nCPAP. There was an initial thought that there may be cellulitis in\nthe left lower extremity , however this was born out clinically and\nshe was initially started on I.V. oxacillin in the Emergency Room\nbut this was stopped after one day. Of note , her chest pain seemed\nto be quite esophageal or reflux related and she was started on\nAxid with remarkable decrease in her symptoms. Sputum culture was\nobtained and showed oral flora. She had no infiltrate on chest\nx-ray and was not treated for bronchitis either.",

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE  This is a 70-year-old man with multiple medical\nproblems including CAD , CHF and cancer with head and neck\npresenting with change in mental status possibly due to his\nmethadone dosage versus infectious etiology namely pneumonia.\nHyperglycemia at admission may have been contributory.\nPulmonary: Blood cultures were negative for growth. He was\ninitially placed on cefotaxime and Flagyl and was changed to p.o.\nmeds , per G-tube meds Flagyl and cefpodoxime. He was continued\non his albuterol nebulizer , Atrovent and a repeat chest x-ray\nafter intravenous fluids revealed slight improvement. He , from\nthe respiratory standpoint , gradually improved with marked\nincrease in activity and alertness by the day of discharge.\nNeuro and Psych: His change in mental status was thought to be\ndue in large part to his methadone changes in dose. He was taken\noff the methadone and was eventually placed on Zyprexa 2.5 mg at\nnight and 2.5 mg at noon. He did wax and wane in terms of his\norientation sometimes thinking he was not at the hospital but he\nalways had the correct date , correct season and knew generally\nwhat the current events at that time.\nCardiovascularly , he was diuresed gently but otherwise has no\nchange in status.\nPalliative care: Palliative Care made numerous recommendations\nthat we followed , one was to treat with Zyprexa 2.5 mg at night\nand at noon to stabilize his mental status fluctuations. This\ncame with uncertain effect as at discharge but overall his\nfunctionality had improved and the amount of time he was aware\nand communicative was overall lengthened. We also started him on\nfluconazole IV and changed per G-tube upon discharge for\ntreatment of oral thrush.\nEndocrine: He was placed on Regular Insulin sliding scale while\non his tube feeds. We also added insulin NPH standing order for\n8 units at morning.\nCode status: The possibility of DNR/DNI was discussed at length\nwith the patient and with his family and they repeatedly and\nultimately decided to have Mr. Lieber be DNR/DNI at this point.\nThey understand the ramifications of this and are comfortable\nwith this decision.",

She subsequently also switched over to\nvancomycin , Ceptaz , and Flagyl to cover for pseudomonas. Her\nurine culture grew out yeast and her blood culture was negative\nto date. Her antibiotic regimen was changed back to\nlevofloxacin , Flagyl on p.o. regimen. On postoperative day #4 ,\nshe was improving. She did have one brief episode of\nhypertension on hospital day #2 that responded to IV fluids. She\nhas required no escalation in antibiotics and tolerated\nlevofloxacin and Flagyl quite well. She will continue her\nlevofloxacin and Flagyl for an additional 14 days.

For example she was thinking that the resident\nis her niece. Psych , onch , and geriatrics was asked to see the\npatient at the son's request. Both psy onc and geriatrics\nbelieved that her change in mental status is multifactorial , and\nis likely a result of delirium rather than dementia. They\nrecommended avoiding pain meds and oversedating meds and started\nher on zyprexa 5mg bid , 2.5mg bid prn agitation , and can increase\nto 10mg po qhs if necessary for agitation. She was continued on\nher Lamictal and Cymbalta and has no further neurological\ndecompensation. Her Seroquel was decreased to 50 mg b.i.d.\np.r.n. and Zydis 5 mg p.o. p.r.n. , however , she was not receiving\nthese medications as she was not agitated.

These\nwere characterized by emesis followed by loss of consciousness with\na question of seizure like activity. This had occurred on a yearly\nbasis for 8-10 years. Such an episode occurred on March At that\ntime , his mother brought him to the Harwelliew Oker Medical Centers Emergency Room\nbecause he developed a facial hematoma after one of these episodes.",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION-3": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  In the Emergency Room he was noted to be\nsomewhat groggy with a brief episode of\napparent loss of consciousness with a question of apnea. He was\nsent to head CT for a scan and at that time he vomiting with loss\nof consciousness and a decrease in heart rate to 30 beats per\nminute. He was intubated in the CT scan room , sedated and paralyzed\nwhile the study was completed. When he arrived in the Intensive\nCare Unit , he had a heart beat in the 20s with complete heart\nblock , which was transient and with subsequent return to normal\nsinus rhythm. The remainder of his exam was remarkable for an S4\nand I/VI systolic ejection murmur. NEURO: The neurological exam was\nnonfocal.",

Chest X-ray\nraised the question of an infiltrate in the left base. The head CT\nwas negative. His course in the MICU was as follows: He ruled out\nfor myocardial infarction , despite an elevated CK. The MB fraction\nwas negative on electrophoresis. On the morning of February , he\nspiked a temperature to 102.3 and was begun on Penicillin. Later on\nFebruary he had an episode of complete heart block with asystole for\n9 seconds.

At that\ntime , he was hemodynamically stable , except for intermittent\nhypertension , which was treated with Nifedipine. He was\ntransferred to the Cardiology Wa Nas O on March , 1993 to await\npacemaker placement. He was switched from Nifedipine to Captopril\nfor treatment of his hypertension and his fever was treated with\nCefotetan for presumed aspiration pneumonia. This has resulted in a\ndelay in his pacemaker placement. He intermittently had a\npericardial friction rub on physical examination that was thought\nto be most likely due to myocardial irritation by the pacing wire\nimplantation. One echocardiogram in a series did reveal a regional\nwall motion abnormality that may have been a function of the\npacemaker wire as well. He remained afebrile and completed a course\nof antibiotics for his presumed aspiration pneumonia , although\nsubsequent chest x-rays did not support that diagnosis. He\nrequired replacement of his temporary pacemaker wire while awaiting\npermanent pacemaker placement to decrease the risk of infection.\nHe underwent permanent pacemaker placement in the Operating Room\nwith anesthesia backup in case there was need for intubation\nbecause the patient had difficulty remaining still.

The patient continue to have Ancef for chest tube\ncoverage.\nThe patient was again seen by the electrophysiology service for\npossible change in his rhythm. The rhythm was Wenckebach and the\npatient was evaluated for a possible pacemaker. On postoperative\nday number three the patient was hemodynamically stable weaning of\nof Neoral but still on Dopamine and still requiring a Lasix drip at\n10 per hour. The patient was still in Wenckebach and the patient\ncontinued to breathe well however remained at 70%. The patient\nremained NPO as his respiratory needs took precidence over his\neating and the risk of aspiration was high. The patient continued\nto make good urine output however was dependent on the Lasix.\nChest tubes were discontinued on this day. The patient was\nre-evaluated by the electrophysiology service again. On\npostoperative day number four the patient received a pacemaker and\nLasix was discontinued on postoperative day number four. The\npacemaker was placed by Dr. Bruess . For more details of this\nsurgery please refer to his operative note. A Medtronic lead was\nplaced.\nOn postoperative day number five the patient continued to do\nextremely well. The patient was AV-paced on the pacemaker at a\nrate of 80 with a good blood pressure of 155/70. He weaned down\noff of all of his drips and pressure support. The patient was able\nto come down to four liters and was able to advance on his diet.\nThe patient made good urine output with only p.o. Lasix and the\nLasix drip was discontinued. The patient was continued on Kefzol\nfor perioperative AICD placement and transfer to the floor. On\npostoperative day six and seven the patient continued to do\nextremely well with no change in his management. The patient\ncontinued on his Lasix , Lopressor and aspirin and Keflex. An\nechocardiogram was done that showed an ejection fraction of 30-40\npercent. There was no change in his management. The patient\ncontinued to do well advancing in all areas.

The patient with plain film and\nx-ray , which did not show any large prepatellar bursal effusion.\nNo other trauma or fracture to be seen on x-ray. The patient was\ndoing well in-house , however , the erythema and pain did not\nrespond to IV vancomycin and p.o. levofloxacin at renal dosing ,\nand was thought by rheumatology who graciously consulted on this\npatient to have a likely prepatellar bursitis. It is also\npossible this patient had a cellulitis overlying the prepatellar\narea , but there is no evidence of joint infection. Tap on\n4/15/05 of the prepatellar bursal fluid showed no crystals , no\npolynuclear cells , and no organisms were seen. Given this ,\nagain , prepatellar bursitis is the primary diagnosis and the pain\ndid slowly resolve while inhouse. The patient was able to bend\nthe knee and do weightbearing , although with pain prior to\ndischarge without any evidence of systemic infection or sepsis.\nBlood cultures on admission were no growth. Prior to discharge ,\nRheumatology suggested starting colchicine 0.6 mg b.i.d. for two\ndays followed by 0.6 mg daily for two days , followed by every\nother day 0.6 mg for one week. Follow up with Wamai Hospital\nas an outpatient , to follow up prepatellar bursitis and to check\nuric acid , although normal on admission at this time. The\npatient was stable without any signs of joint infection or\nspreading fascial infection or worsening cellulitis. The\npatient will also be started on Keflex despite the fact that he\ndid not respond to antibiotics , and this is likely a prepatellar\nbursitis. In case , it is small component of cellulitis , the\npatient will be kept on 10 days of p.o. Keflex at renal dose 500\nmg b.i.d. as an outpatient and will be followed by Way Oa Hospital in the future.\n2. Diabetes mellitus: The patient was initially not placed on\nhome NPH 50 mg b.i.d. and required increased NovoLog sliding\nscale to 10 standing q.a.c. plus sliding scale. However , after\naddition of 50 mg b.i.d. , NPH as per patient's home dose , the\npatient's blood sugars ranged from 90s to 180s , which is far\nimproved from prior sugars in the 300s on admission. The patient\nwill continue on home dose NPH insulin with a NovoLog sliding\nscale. Also will continue oral Avandia.\n3. Cardiovascular: There were no active issues on this\nadmission.\n4. Pain: The patient had approximately two to three times 25 mg\nof oxycodone p.r.n. for pain. This will be continued for several\ndays as needed for pain on discharge.\n5. Vascular: The patient with full LENI did not show any\nthrombus in the right lower extremity on LENI.\n6. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency , which\nlooks like acute on chronic given for unknown reasons , the\npatient was initially placed on Lasix b.i.d. , but was taken down\nto 80 mg once a day for lower extremity edema and swelling , given\ncreatinine of approximately 1.9 to 2.2. Discharge creatinine was\n2.0. This will be followed up by Villerich Deo Hospital as an\noutpatient.

The patient had\na negative PPD placed three induced sputum for TB , which were all\nnegative. SPEP and UPEP had increased gamma globulins , but he\nwas polyclonal and no end spikes. A chest CT showed large\nmediastinal lymphadenopathy with multiple 2-3 cm nodes. No\nintraparenchymal disease. A mediastinoscopy for biopsy and\nintraoperative BAL were done and the pathology and microbiology\nare pending at the time of discharge. Abdominal CT was negative.\n2. Renal. Baseline creatinine is 2-3. Creatinine increased to\n6 on admission and was down to 3.4 with aggressive hydration by\nthe time of discharge. There were no casts in her urine. Her\nphenol was 11.6% on admission. It was thought that her acute\nrenal failure was secondary to prerenal azotemia as well as a\ncomponent of ATN and tubular damage from the hypercalcemia. Her\ncreatinine remains stable around 3.4 on discharge.\n3. Pulmonary. She did not have any pulmonary symptoms except\nfor a mild cough that had resolved on admission. She did have\npersistent bibasilar crackles , which were old per her PCP. She\nhad no shortness of breath and her saturations remain greater\nthan 96% on room air throughout admission.

She\nhas a normocytic anemia , but given her chronic renal\ninsufficiency she has a mild degree of iron deficiency. The\nlikely etiology of her anemia is secondary to renal disease.\nIron supplementation was started. Hematocrit was stable\nthroughout admission.\n5. Endocrine. The patient has a history of diabetes and was\nhypoglycemic on admission. This resolved with hydration. Her\nPTH was 26 , her vitamin D was 27 , PTHrP is pending. She was kept\non a regular insulin sliding scale during the admission. She\nresumed her NPH dose as an outpatient on discharge. She will\nneed a close follow up of blood sugars as an outpatient.

His antibiotics were discontinued after 14 days and\nhe remained afebrile with the normal white count. Of note , on\n10/30/05 , he had another episode of vomiting , which was thought\nto result in another aspiration event. However , repeat chest\nx-rays showed no additional pneumonia and given that he was\ntreated with a full two-week course of antibiotics it was decided\nto end his course of antibiotics and he remained afebrile with a\nnormal white blood cell count.\n2. Cardiovascular: The patient initially had ST elevations\nnormalized. This was thought likely to be due to demand ischemia\ngiven its complete resolution. Per Cardiology recommendations ,\nhe was not a candidate for long-term anticoagulation or cardiac\ncatheterization. He was continued on medical management without\nfurther incident.\n3. Hypertension: The patient was persistently hypertensive and\nhis blood pressure medications were titrated up and additional\nmedications were added as described in discharge medication list.\n4. Diabetes: The patient's insulin regimen was titrated up to\ncover persistently high morning blood sugars given tube feeds\novernight.\n5. Neurological: The patient had a baseline aphasia and was\ndifficult to communicate with , however , as his pneumonia\nresolved , his mental status improved and he was able to\ncommunicate with short phrases and answer yes or no questions.\n6. FEN: He was receiving tube feeds overnight per Nutrition\nrecommendations. He was also receiving NPH and regular insulin\nas described in discharge medications.\n7.

In March 2003 , he\nhad debridement of the pacemaker pocket and was doing fine , and\nthen over the week leading up to this admission , he developed\nitching and tenderness of his right chest at the pacemaker site.\nHe was sent to the emergency room from hemodialysis today for\nevaluation of his infected site. The pacemaker at that point was\nscheduled to be removed on 9/3/03 , and when he was seen in the\nemergency room , he denied any chest pain , shortness of breath ,\nnausea , vomiting , diarrhea , cough , sputum production.\nPAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: End stage renal disease on\nhemodialysis , hepatitis C , history\nof MRSA bacteremia , hypertension , CAD , status post MI , sick sinus\nsyndrome , status post pacemaker in 1998 , history of closed head\ninjury with subsequent mental retardation , history of\nhyperparathyroids , status post parathyroidectomy , status post\npartial gastrectomy for a peptic ulcer disease.",

EKG normal sinus\nrhythm , no ST segment changes , left axis deviation and LVH , no\npacemaker spikes noted.\nHOSPITAL COURSE/ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. ID - Candida non-albicans\ngrew out of his cultures from\nhis hemodialysis center. He was started on amphotericin-B with an\nID consult , and will complete a four week course on 11/16/03. His\ncultures here at the Tholond Crawni Hospital remain negative. They removed his\ninfected pacemaker , as well as his Hickman catheter. He has been\nafebrile here for the last several weeks , 2-3 weeks prior to\ndischarge.\n2. Cardiovascular - ( A ) Rhythm - His pacemaker was removed. It\nhad been interrogated not long prior to his admission here and had\nnot been firing , and therefore , did not appear to be needed anyway.\nHe had to return to the EP lab a second time for a lead extraction ,\nas they were unable to pull out the leads on the first attempt. By\nhis repeat echoes , however , he appears to have a retained pacemaker\nwire although EP believes that they removed the entire wire for all\nintents and purposes. It should be assumed that he does have a\nretained wire , however. Also , the patient had episodes of atrial\nflutter with rapid ventricular response and a decreased blood\npressure after his pacemaker was removed. He was ultimately\ntreated with amiodarone with excellent control over his weight and\nrhythm , and has been in normal sinus rhythm for the last week or so\nprior to discharge. There are no plans for pacemaker placement at\nthis time. ( B ) Ischemia - He complained of chest pain while he was\nhere and ruled out for a MI. ( C ) Pump - Hypertensive while in\natrial flutter and then again during an episode of acute blood\nloss. Since both issues have resolved , his blood pressures have\nbeen very stable. He is to be continued on his Vasotec and\nLopressor. ( D ) Vascular - He had a traumatic left groin line\nattempt. Vascular , subsequently , performed a groin exploration ,\nhematoma evacuation , and sutured his vascular laceration. The\npatient continued to lose a significant amount of blood into his\nthigh , requiring several units of blood and one unit of platelets.\nHis hematocrit , however , has now been stable for one week prior to\ndischarge. He has a follow-up appointment with vascular on\n0/4/03.\n3. FEN/GU - Hemodialysis patent , very poor access. After removal\nof his possibly infected hemodialysis catheter , IR was completely\nunable to place an IJ or subclavian catheter on either side.\nUltimately , they had to place a tunnelled right groin line which is\nvery poor long-term option. He has a followup in vascular clinic with Dr Granfield\non 0/24/03 to address his access issue , for possible creatine of a groin\nAVfistula or graft.\n4. Heme - Hematocrit now stable , high 20s , low 30s. B12 and\nfolate are normal.\n5. Disposition - The patient is to be discharged to rehab on\n6/23/03 in stable condition. He has become very deconditioned\nwhile he was here in the hospital as he was unable to get much PT\nhere given both his groin hematoma and some of his groin access\nissues. Now there are no restrictions on his activity as his right\ngroin line is tunnelled.",

He\nunderwent cardiac catheterization on August , 1998 which showed 50\npercent left main obstruction and 90 percent complex mid left\nanterior descending. His right coronary artery was occluded. The\npatient did well both during and after the catheterization. The\npatient underwent a stress mibi test with a viability study on March , 1998 which showed ischemia during his exercise tolerance test.\nThe mibi showed severe ischemia in 11/25 segments , as well as an\ninfarct on the apical septum , apex , and base of the inferior wall.\nOptions were considered including coronary artery bypass grafting\nand angioplasty. After a long discussion with the Cardiology\nService , Cardiac Surgery , the Renal Service and the patient , the\ndecision was made to proceed with angioplasty. On August , 1998 ,\nthe patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary\nangioplasty of his right coronary artery with zero percent residual\nblockage. He also had two stents into his left anterior descending\nwith zero percent residual blockage. The patient tolerated the\nprocedure well.\n2. Renal: The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma for\nwhich he underwent a nephrectomy in 1994. He also has chronic\nrenal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy. As surgery was being\nconsidered for his cardiac disease , a Renal consultation was\nobtained to evaluate his renal status. He underwent a renal\nultrasound showing an exophytic mass in his solitary kidney. This\nwas very concerning for recurrence of carcinoma. He then underwent\nan MRI study which showed a nonenhancing mass in the kidney which\nwas most consistent with a hyperdense , proteinaceous cyst. This\nwas reassuring , though cancer could not be ruled out 100 percent.\nThe patient's renal function remained stable throughout his\nhospitalization.\n3. Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was\nplaced on an insulin sliding scale during his hospitalization. He\nwas instructed to continue with his Glyburide , and to follow-up as\nusual with his outpatient provider.\nThe patient was discharged to home on March , 1998 , one day\nfollowing his second catheterization procedure.

His intraoperative course was\nuncomplicated. On postoperative day number one , he was weaned to\nextubation and he was treated with stress steroids to prevent\nsteroid withdrawal. On postoperative day number one , he was taken\nback to the operating room for bleeding. After he was extubated ,\nhe was reintubated and was returned in good and stable condition to\nthe intensive care unit on renal Dopamine. He was again extubated\nand was seen in consultation by the Gastrointestinal Service for a\nquestion of gastrointestinal bleed since there was a clot seen on\nthe transesophageal echocardiogram probe at its withdrawal from his\nfirst surgery. The Gastrointestinal Service saw any evidence of\nany upper gastrointestinal bleed and he was maintained on H2\nblockers. He was sent to the step down unit on routine\npostoperative day number two and his Captopril was increased for\nafterload reduction. His course improved and he was diuresed for a\nvolume overload still requiring oxygen supplementation on two\nliters. His oxygen saturation was only 91% on postoperative day\nnumber three. He continued to improve and continued to have care\nfor his respiratory situation with continued diuresis and nebulizer\ntreatments and ambulation.

        "HOSPITAL COURSE-12": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted to the general medical\nservice for evaluation of syncope. She was\nmonitored over the weekend and no arrhythmias were picked up on\ncardiac monitor. The patient underwent echocardiography which\nshowed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of\n80%. There were no wall motion abnormalities. There was also noted\nmild left atrial enlargement and mild aortic valve sclerosis. Due\nto the worrisome nature of patient's history of angina-like\nsymptoms , she went directly to cardiac catheterization , which\nrevealed heavily calcified LAD and RCA. The LAD showed proximal\nstenosis of 30 to 40% , circumflex showed proximal stenosis of 30%\nand the RCA showed proximal stenosis of 30%. It was felt that this\nrepresented mild CAD and most likely could not explain the source\nof the patient's syncopal episode. The patient also underwent\nelectrophysiology study which showed no evidence for ventricular\narrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias as cause of syncope. The patient\ncontinued to have no arrhythmic events on cardiac monitor\nthroughout her hospital stay. The patient tolerated the cardiac\ncath well and did well during the postprocedure period. The\npatient's diltiazem was discontinued thinking that it may\ncontribute to heart block given the fact that she has a\nbifascicular block. THe patient was started on nifedipine XL. The\npatient was discharged home with close follow-up with her primary\ncare physician , Dr. Mendoca .",

In fact , your studies were improved from\nyour previous studies of yoru heart. It seems that your pain is likely\nmore due to your shoulder arthritis since the heart study we\nperformed was negative for blood flow problems to the heart. When you\nhave shoulder pain , you should try heat to the painful area ( or ice if\nthat helps more ) as well as Tylenol. You may also try ibuprofen in small\ndoses. Ibuprofen ( also known as Advil or Motrin ) is available in generic\nform in your drugstore. It is not good for your stomach or your kidneys\nso you should take only a very small amount as detailed in your discharge\nsummary. Because you had low blood sugar on admission to the hospital\nwe would like for you to take your diabetes pills only once a day\ninstead of twice a day until Dr. Daghita tells you differently.Your\nmedications are otherwise unchanged from your medications prior to your\nadmission. If you have weakness , shortness of breath , or\nany other concerning symptoms you should seek medical attention\nimmediately.",

        "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS-3": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Cardiac risk factors include a history\nof hypertension , hypercholesterolemia ,\nremote history of smoking , questionable positive family history ,\nand no diabetes mellitus. The patient has had a history of\ncoronary artery disease , is status post multiple myocardial\ninfarctions. In the 1970s the patient had a myocardial infarction\nnumber 1 and in 1992 he had his second myocardial infarction , non Q\nwave MI , refused catheterization. ETT was done and he was treated\nwith Atenolol and Isordil. In 2/25/93 the patient had an anterior\nmyocardial infarction and subsequently had a V-tach , V-fib arrest ,\nconverted with 200 joules at Mid-ma Hospital and received TPA ,\nheparin , Lidocaine , and his peak CPK value was 7975. Echo revealed\nan ejection fraction of 20% with anterior apical akinesis , left\natrial enlargement. The course was complicated by post MI chest\npain. On 4/17/93 the patient was transferred to Rahfletchgreenesouth Rehabilitation Hospital Of Cardiac catheterization at that point revealed 90% LAD\nlesion and 100% PDA lesion , 90% D1 lesion , and the patient had PTCA\nof LAD to a remaining 40% lesion and D1 PTCA with 40% residual.\nPost PTCA course was complicated by flash pulmonary edema and\nanterior ST elevation which led to emergent cath which revealed a\n70% LAD , 100% D1 lesion , and this re-occlusion was treated with\nrepeat PTCA of LAD and intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient was\ngiven Captopril and Lasix for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Since then ,\nthe patient was medically managed and in his usual state of health\nwithout any chest pain for the two years until about three days\nprior to admission when patient had vague abdominal pain ,\nepigastric ache , and cramp occurring intermittently , lasting for\n4-6 hour episodes. Occasionally the patient was awaken from sleep.\nHe denied orthopnea , PND , edema. The patient's pain was similar\nto but not identical to peptic ulcer disease pain. The patient\ndenied chest pain. On 9/17/96 , the patient was seen by Dr. Mcgray\nof PVH . The patient continued to have abdominal pain. Patient\nhad CHF on examination. An EKG revealed new lateral T wave\nchanges. The patient was sent to Tanjuan Tialan Vition Hospital and there the\npatient became diaphoretic , was short of breath , improved with\nnitroglycerin and therefore was transferred to Bert Stern Medical Center\nIn the Emergency Room , the patient had shortness of breath , blood\npressure elevated to 210/110 , heart rate of 118 , continued to have\nabdominal pain and development of chest pain typical of angina. He\nreceived Lopressor , IV TNG , aspirin , no heparin secondary to\nincreased INR to 2.8 , and his shortness of breath subsequently\nimproved. Chest pain resolved. His EKG had T wave inversions in\nV5 through V6.",

Abdomen was soft , non-tender ,\nnondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. A ventral hernia was present\nwhich was easily reducible. Extremities showed no cyanosis ,\nclubbing , or edema. Neuro examination was nonfocal. Rectal was\nguaiac negative per the Emergency Ward.",
        "LABORATORY EXAMINATION-10": "LABORATORY EXAMINATION  Sodium of 144 , potassium of 3.5. He had a\nhematocrit of 43.6 and white blood count\nof 9.8. LFTs were within normal range. PT of 20.2 , PTT of 38.2 ,\nINR of 2.8. ABG on 100% face mask revealed 7.33 , 45 , 193 , 99.6% in\nthe Emergency Room. Abdominal ultrasound in the Emergency Room\nrevealed right renal stones , but no hydronephrosis , no gallbladder\nstones , no evidence of triple A. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly ,\nlow volume lungs without clear evidence of CHF. EKG upon arrival\nin the Emergency Ward revealed sinus tachycardia , T wave flattening\nin AVL , T wave inversion V4 through V6 which were new , poor R wave\nprogression which was old. Pain free EKG revealed resolution of T\nwave inversion in V4 through V6.",
        "HOSPITAL COURSE-11": "HOSPITAL COURSE  The patient was admitted for the rule out MI\nprotocol. He actually ruled out for a myocardial\ninfarction with a CPK of 168 , CPK2 of 138 , and CPK3 of 147.\nHowever on 0/9/96 his T wave inversion in V1 and V2 were noted to\nbe deeper on C set compared to A set. Subsequently that day the\npatient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema. As his IV heparin\nand TNG were being turned down he became acutely short of breath\nwith bilateral crackles half way up the lung fields. He was found\nto be in flash pulmonary edema which was treated with heparin , IV\nTNG , and also Lasix. The patient did very well after that and his\ntroponin level at that point was 0. The patient's CPKs were\nrecycled and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction again.\nHis ABG at that point and during his acute episode of shortness of\nbreath was 7.37 , 43 , pO2 of 111 on 6 liters , and after diuresis he\nwas able to be on room air without any difficulty. It was\ntherefore decided for the patient to have cardiac catheterization.\nCardiac catheterization was performed on 7/21/96 which revealed\nproximally occluded LAD , 60-70% lesion of OM1 , and 99% lesion of\nproximal PDA , and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction with\nextensive anterior apical akinesis and also inferior apical\nakinesis. Based on this it was decided that the patient had three\nvessel disease. In anticipation of surgical conservation the\npatient had a ETT MIBI on 11/27/96 and he was able to go on modified\nBruce protocol 6 minutes. He stopped secondary to fatigue. He did\nnot achieve target heart rate. His maximum heart rate was 104 and\n85% of the predicted value. Subsequently the MIBI results revealed\nanterior wall and septum and apex to be nonfunctional , however the\npatient had known transmural myocardial infarction in inferior wall\nwhich revealed viable myocardium there and also lateral wall\nnonfunctioning wall. These are the preliminary results. It was\ndecided for the patient to have maximal medical management prior to\nconsideration for surgery. The patient's Isordil dose was\nincreased while in hospital and his Coumadin was restarted.",
